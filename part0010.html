  <p class="noindent">We, of course, get a steady stream of requests from people who have lost contact with friends or family. These lost individuals are often young adults on the Big OE, or overseas experience, who have managed to get themselves waylaid somewhere around Southeast Asia. Koh Pang Nan is a popular haunt for such wide-eyed travellers. One reason perhaps: during the famed monthly full-moon parties, it is far easier to find a wandering beach vendor selling your particular drug of choice than it is to find one selling food or drink! Consequently, losing track of time, or failing to call home, is not all that uncommon.</p>

  <p class="indent">In one of these cases, Beth and Harry from downtown Saskatoon, Canada had contacted me, as they were worried about their son Joel, especially after the murderous tsunami of December 2004. Following the usual background info and pictures, I determined that Joel, who had recently graduated from Saskatchewan University, was unlikely to make the local hockey team or become a star quarterback. I could well imagine that for this young man, a rather slight, bespectacled lad, many sights throughout the Asian region would have indeed been real eye-openers for him.</p>

  <p class="indent">The last contact Beth and Harry had received was an email from an Internet café in Ho Chi Minh two weeks previously. Joel had said he was going to head across Laos to Thailand, and possibly return home after spending some time in Bangkok. Although it was some months after the disaster, I still had to assure them that his travel plans were very much inland, and the chances of a tsunami sailing up the Mekong were rather remote.</p>

  <p class="indent">The easiest method of getting through Laos to Bangkok from Vietnam would be to go via Vientiane, and then across the Friendship Bridge at Nong Khai, straight down the main highway to the City of Angels, as Bangkok is known. Nevertheless, backpackers tend to pick up maps, look at the shortest route rather than the easiest and head that way.</p>

  <p class="indent">I had friends at the Vientiane-Nong Khai border checkpoint, so I arranged for the usual few bottles of Johnny Walker Black to be delivered to them before I made a call to see if Joel’s entry visa had shown up on records over the past fortnight. That proved, unfortunately, to be a negative. As is generally the case in the private eye business, nothing is simple, even though clients often assure you that it will be! Tracking down the recently un-sighted Saskatchewanian was going to entail more than a few phone calls.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mukdahan is a small city in Thailand’s far northeast, on the banks of the Mekong river. It has a sister city in Laos sitting almost opposite called Savannakhet. Border crossings here are not very common, but do happen, and I could imagine that to the uninitiated sitting in a Vietnamese café staring at a map, it would appear to be a more direct route to travel overland to Thailand.</p>

  <p class="indent">At the time, I also had to see if a wayward Pattaya bargirl was at her home in the neighbouring province of Ubon Ratchathani. Deciding to package the two investigations together, I opted for a rental car and a couple of days driving, which in upcountry Thailand is as hazardous an undertaking as any I faced in my whole time as a PI. Inebriated motorists, crazed bus drivers high on No-Doze, families of four or five all perched precariously on small motorcycles, and itinerant buffalo that tend to charge across highways from time to time all add to the perils of road travel there in the Kingdom of Smiles.</p>

  <p class="indent">I drove as far as Ubon Ratchatani, where the Pathumrat Hotel disco had been an interesting venue in the past, and was I looking forward to again checking out the local talent! After a short nap and a meal, I was ready to take on the night, so I slipped the disco manager a few hundred baht to secure a table in a prime location – and also to allow me to take my bottle of Jack Daniels in with me, which I trusted would attract a few of the local lovelies in my direction.</p>

  <p class="indent">It wasn’t too long before my interest was well and truly aroused: a very raunchy Thai singer bounced out and served up a fair rendition of <i class="calibre5">“Rong Dung Dung”,</i> which means along the lines of “sing out loudly” and is a hit made famous by Palmy, the Thai answer to Alanis Morisste. I quickly summoned a nearby waiter and poured Miss Ubon a stiff JD, which wasn’t the only thing stiff in the nightclub at that point. The drink was passed up to her, lots of smiles were exchanged, and she knocked it back like a trouper. Things were looking up. I even offered a decent tip to the waiter, who only then thought to tell me the singer was married to the drummer. The frivolities sort of went downhill from there and the long drive started to take its toll. As I had an early start in the morning, I put the top back on the remaining Jack Daniels, and retired for the evening.</p>

  <p class="indent">I therefore woke up fairly fresh in the morning, took advantage of the hotel breakfast included in the room price, and by 9 am was on the road, in search of a small village that was home to one Metta Chaikwang, former employee of Pattaya’s Freelancer Bar, and now supposedly retired, awaiting a UK visa, and looking forward to a life in Luton, England.</p>

  <p class="indent">I didn’t have to venture too far off the main road to find the village, although as usual in these instances, I was very thankful for my ability to speak Thai fluently. Rather than go to her home, I called in to the local store and stocked up on a few travel snacks. Of course, the curious Thai shop owner wanted to know what I was doing, so, as planned, I simply said I was a friend of Metta’s and, as I was in the area, had called in to say hello, but she wasn’t home.</p>

  <p class="indent">“No, she won’t be home until <i class="calibre5">Songkran,”</i> I was told, which more or less confirmed what I needed to know, without alerting the family. I had been reasonably sure that it would only be the Thai New Year family reunion that would see her leave the bright-lights and comforts of Pattaya for the somewhat dull and boring life in a small Thai village.</p>

  <p class="indent">I drove slowly past the Chaikwang family home, noting that it was one of the better ones in the village, which to the cynical Thai Private Eye man, either meant the family owned a business or had some good-looking daughters. I pulled out my camera and clicked off a few shots. The only sign of life was a plump middle-aged woman hanging out some washing, none of which would have ever graced the lithe form of a 45-kilogram bargirl.</p>

  <p class="indent">That task completed, I continued on to Mukdahan, and by lunchtime, was seated in the Ploy Hotel restaurant, gazing out across the Mekong at neighbouring Laos. Figuring a quick afternoon chat with the local Immigration officers might go a fair way towards completing the second chore, I picked up a bottle of Johnny Walker Black and sauntered down to find their office. There were only two men present. The senior one asked in halting English what I was after, obviously relieved when I answered him in Thai. I told him my young brother had gone missing, and I wanted to know if he had entered the Kingdom recently. I was then asked for my passport, proof that I was indeed a family member, even though I had used the Thai word <i class="calibre5">“nong”,</i> which covers not only an actual brother or sister, but is also conveniently used to include younger relatives or even friends. The officer then went on to point out the difference between my surname and the one I had written down and was querying about. He then explained that such information could not be given to anyone who was not a direct relative.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mmmm; that crackdown on corruption across the Kingdom might be good for Thailand’s reputation worldwide, I thought, but it certainly wasn’t a lot of help to the average PI. As I had found over the years, the seemingly simple approach to getting my queries answered seldom works, which is why I always try and have a Plan B ready. I picked up my bottle of Johnny, politely thanked the men for their time, and headed down to the nearby jetty. I paid a departure fee, and waited for the next ferry across the river to Savannakhet. I was sure the anti-corruption drive had not as of yet found its way into Laos! Picking up a bag of pineapple from a vendor while waiting, I learnt that the previous Immigration chief had recently been sacked – or as they politely term it, removed to an inactive post. No wonder the new man was playing things by the rules … for now anyway.</p>

  <p class="indent">It only took a few minutes to complete the crossing, and a 100 baht tip to a young official got me personally delivered to the local head of the Savannakhet Immigration office. My command of Lao was not great, but, along with a combination of Thai and a 1000 baht note to go with the Johnny Walker, I was soon shown the ledger of all foreigners who had exited Laos at Savannakhet in the past month. Luckily, there was only one Canadian on the list: Joel had crossed into Thailand ten days previously.</p>

  <p class="indent">I thanked my new Laotian friend profusely, declining the offer to share some whiskey with him. I wanted to catch the next ferry back, as dusk was approaching. Safely ferried back across the river, I alighted and shortly afterwards adjourned once more to the Ploy restaurant. I opted for the <i class="calibre5">pla nin,</i> a very tasty type of perch, while I contemplated my next move. Or, more to the point, Joel’s possible moves over the previous ten days.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mukdahan is something of a sleepy hollow, and although there was no doubt the obligatory massage parlour and karaoke venue (or two) secreted away somewhere, it certainly is not a place known for its nightlife. I found a small Internet café and shot off a quick email to Betty and Harry, who I knew would be relived to know that Joel had safely navigated Vietnam and Laos. I also asked them if Joel had made any mention of, or had any tendencies towards, Buddhism, and if so, could they confirm ASAP.</p>

  <p class="indent">I then headed back to the hotel, making a mental note that not too many Bangkok bargirls seem to hail from this province, and that whilst everyone I came into contact with was most friendly and polite, there was a noticeable lack of any potential movie stars or models. In fact, the last time I had ventured to Mukdahan had been on behalf of a client who was due to marry the love of his life, until my further investigation revealed that his intended was a male – and I was fairly sure that a same sex marriage was not what my client had in mind!</p>

  <p class="indent">I took a detour, passing by the local bus and train stations to see if anyone had any recollection of Joel, but although a number of locals claimed to have seen him, or someone similar, I was aware it was more a matter of trying to be helpful rather than factual. After all, we Caucasians all look the same to them!</p>

  <p class="indent">At most upcountry hotels, things are normally quiet mid-week, unless one of the many conferences that Thais love to organize is in progress. The Ploy Hotel was no exception, so, not surprisingly, the rather bored night manager came over to say <i class="calibre5">“Sawadee khap”,</i> perhaps in the mistaken belief I was someone of importance, as I savoured a quiet JD and Coke. I asked him to share a drink, which proved to be a worthwhile offer, as in return for this courtesy, he told me I was welcome to pop down early in the morning and use the office computer to check my email. That was most helpful indeed, as it would save me waiting until 10 am for the Internet shops to open.</p>

  <p class="indent">A brisk “You have mail” greeted me the following morning, when, yet again fresh and bright, I made myself at home in the small office behind the hotel reception and logged on to the hotel computer. Betty had answered, most pleased to know her son was now in Thailand, and wondering if I was psychic: Joel had indeed mentioned in his last email that he was interested in visiting some temples and learning a little more about Buddhist beliefs.</p>

  <p class="indent">Whether it’s being psychic, having intuition, sixth sense, or more likely just a combination of those added to commonsense and experience, I regularly seemed to come up with an answer that at first appeared unlikely, but ultimately proved correct. It was a handy attribute in my field.</p>

  <p class="indent">Seeing temples and monks everywhere, noting their calm manner, the respect the locals have for them, and indeed the overall friendly manner of most Southeast Asian people, it’s not at all surprising that many travellers want to learn more about the culture and beliefs behind it all.</p>

  <p class="indent">Psychic Thai Private Eye therefore put two and two together, added in Joel’s background as far as I knew of it, and surmised that a rather studious, slight and non-sporty young man might find the call of the popular Wat Pha Nana Chat monastery in nearby Ubon Ratchatani province very enticing.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was just under a two-hour drive to the monastery, situated in a forest reserve. The more modern, contemporary buildings, especially the main temple, stood in stark contrast to the usual ancient Khamen-influenced temples in the region I was used to visiting. Again, speaking Thai and knowing the procedure meant it was easy for me to find the new arrivals, who were busy learning meditation chants. There are certainly no ties or hold over anyone at any Thai Buddhist temple, so it was just a matter of waiting for that particular chant to be completed and then motioning to the amber-robed young Canadian who looked somewhat more gaunt than his photo, but nonetheless was easy to spot amongst the half dozen Westerners present.</p>

  <p class="indent">Joel was more than happy to have a talk and admitted to having become so engrossed in his latest beliefs that he had forgotten to update his parents. I know it’s against principle, but I would have bet Betty and Harry’s retainer that the fertile forest grounds also grew a few special mushrooms or some green-leafed herb other than coriander amongst the undergrowth.</p>

  <p class="indent">We had a pleasant chat for an hour or so. Joel wanted to know a lot about the people and the region. I took a picture of him that I said I would send to his parents, and he let me in on his latest plan. A fellow student had told him of a place in Goa where you could buy perfect wooden pipes for just a few cents. You could then sell them in the West for a few dollars, and easily subsidize your travels. Joel was going to buy a thousand and take the Saskatoon pipe market by storm. He was enjoying his time at the monastery, but told me he and his friends had been worried when this morning at dawn prayers, one of the head monks had come to the rear of the temple to sit with them. He said occasionally they had failed to take things seriously, and wondered if perhaps he was being checked up on, or if his stay at the monastery was in jeopardy. I noted an old, senior Thai monk nearby, so I went over to pay my respects, and to see if he could shed some light on Joel’s standing within the community.</p>

  <p class="indent">I returned a few moments later, and assured Joel he had no problem. Apparently the monk had been demoted and sent to sit at the back with the new arrivals. This was not because they needed checking up on, but because the particular Thai monk concerned had unfortunately had some “improper thoughts” the previous evening; hence, the demotion.</p>

  <p class="indent">I wished Joel well in his pipe-selling venture, gave him my number just in case he did run into any difficulty while in the Kingdom, and told him I would pass on his love to his parents when I emailed them later. I would also explain to them that contact with the outside world is difficult from a Thai monastery.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was early afternoon as I drove out of the monastery grounds; with any luck, I thought, I would be back in Bangkok by midnight. There had been the occasional Thai girl who had suggested a stint at a temple to earn merit would not do me any harm, and the odd time that I had considered such a step. However, I now had a family I wanted to be with, and besides, on trips like this, or staked out overnight watching apartment blocks, I certainly didn’t lack for time to meditate.</p>

  <p class="indent">As the Buddhist temples in Thailand are something of a sanctuary, it has often been a strategy of nefarious politicians, about-to-be-found-out husbands, or straight-out criminals to suddenly feel the call of the temple and trust that by the time they step back into the real world, their misdeeds will be forgotten, or charges against them dropped. I had on numerous occasions had Western men inform me that their Thai girlfriends had been out of contact, because they had gone to stay at a temple. Now whilst there are indeed one or two temples for women only (a female is not allowed to touch a Thai monk, or even pass food directly to him), I have yet to see a working girl return to the Bangkok night scene with a shaven head. Still, I haven’t seen the tooth fairy either, and my daughter assures me she is alive and well.</p>

  <p class="indent">Slowly the miles were eaten up, and it was dusk as I passed my personal favourite temple and religious retreat, the ancient Khamen temple of Phanom Roong, looking much as it would have a few thousand years earlier. Not long afterwards, it was the outskirts of Saraburi, and eventually the distant twinkling lights of Bangkok could be seen.</p>

  <p class="indent">I had another premonition that it might be some time before I was travelling that way again, and the amber robes of the monks I had seen close up during the day, I reminded myself, do not represent the sunrise, as many think, but, in fact, the sunset.</p>
