  <p class="noindent">Let me just give you a little insight into the trials and tribulations of being a private eye when, by and large, you are operating on behalf of clients who live thousands of miles away and are used to an entirely different set of rules, regulations and cultural behaviour.
||| Laissez-moi vous donner un petit aperçu des tribulations d'un détective privé qui, dans la majorité des cas, doit opérer au nom de clients vivant à plusieurs milliers de kilomètres et habitués à une culture, des principes, des règles et des comportements tout à fait différents.</p>

  <p class="indent">There are many times when the clients – they who are always right, even when they are wrong – don’t understand the background to a situation, or cannot fathom why certain people may be acting in a certain way. When you live, as I did, for a long period of time in Thailand and become as much Asian as Western; when you instinctively take off your shoes upon entering a home; when you look with disdain at anyone raising his or her voice in public; accept that bribery and corruption are a way of life; and you know that less than 4% of the population pay taxes while unemployment or old-age benefits are totally out of the question, you do develop a deeper understanding of certain patterns of behaviour. In this respect, one tends to become not just a cultural advisor, but also a guide, a mentor; even, at times, a psychiatrist, it seems.
||| Il y a de nombreuses fois où les clients - ceux qui ont toujours raison, même quand ils ont tort - ne saisissent pas le contexte d'une situation, ou ne parviennent pas à comprendre pourquoi certaines personnes agissent d'une manière particulière. Lorsque vous vivez, comme moi, pendant une longue période en Thaïlande et devenez aussi asiatique qu'occidental; quand vous enlevez instinctivement vos chaussures en entrant dans une maison; quand vous regardez avec mépris quiconque élève la voix en public; acceptez que les pot-de-vins et la corruption sont une manière de vivre; et que vous savez que moins de 4% de la population paie des impôts alors que les prestations chômage ou vieillesse sont totalement exclues, vous développez une compréhension profonde de certains schémas ou comportements. À cet égard, on a tendance à devenir non seulement un conseiller culturel, mais aussi un guide, un mentor; et même parfois, paraît-il, un psychiatre .</p>

  <p class="indent">I had set the alarm for 5 am, time to shower, go have a quick breakfast at the 24-hour Foodland on Sukhumvit Road Soi 5, and get out to the airport to catch the early flight to Ho Chi Minh, with an onward to Nha Trang. I walked out of Foodland and up to the corner to get a taxi, and there, hanging about with two or three other down-and-out desperates trying to squeeze some easy income out of a wayward tourist, was Lee.
||| J'avais réglé l'alarme à 5 heures du matin pour avoir le temps de prendre une douche, un petit-déjeuner succinct au Foodland du Soi 5 de Sukhumvit Road ouvert 24h/24, puis me rendre à l'aéroport pour prendre le premier vol vers Ho Chi Minh, avec une correspondance à Nha Trang. Je suis sorti de Foodland jusqu'au coin de la rue pour prendre un taxi, et là, avec deux ou trois autres SDF désespérés essayant de soutirer de l'argent facile à un touriste récalcitrant, une certaine Lee faisait le pied de grue.</p>

  <p class="indent">I reckon I had first seen the lovely Miss Lee about 10 years back, in the days when I was a marketing manager for some of the Kingdom’s resort hotels, and she certainly was a young lovely back then. She had a string of regular sponsors in those days and certainly was much in demand. (For the uninitiated, a sponsor is a man who provides monthly payments to a Thai girlfriend, presumably to keep her studying or otherwise away from bar work.)
||| Je crois avoir vu la charmante demoiselle Lee pour la première fois il y a une dizaine d'années, alors que j'étais directeur du marketing dans un des hôtels de tourisme du Royaume, et elle était une belle jeune fille à l'époque, vous pouvez me croire. Elle avait une kyrielle de sponsors réguliers en ces temps-ci et était sûrement très demandée. Pour les non-initiés, un sponsor est un homme qui verse un paiement mensuel à sa copine Thaï, sans doute pour lui permettre de poursuivre ses études, ou d'une certaine manière la maintenir à distance du monde des bars.</p>

  <p class="indent">Lee was a true country girl, loved her family, and although she had numerous offers, had no intention of marrying someone and living overseas. She thought, however, that one of her beaus would be happy to live in a small village up near the Laos border with her, where they would raise a family and live happily ever after.
||| Lee était une authentique fille de la campagne, aimait sa famille, et malgré les nombreuses demandes de mariage, elle n'avait pas l'intention d'épouser quelqu'un et vivre à l'étranger. Elle estimait cependant que l'un de ses petits amis serait heureux de vivre avec elle dans un petit village près de la frontière laotienne, où ils pourraient élever une famille et vivre heureux.</p>

  <p class="indent">Well, it seemed the first few stages of Lee’s dream were realised: she had had a number of affairs over the years, with the result that now, at the age of 30, she had four children, all from different fathers, three of them Westerners. Unfortunately for her and the children, the guys involved were all long gone. Perhaps some made an occasional money transfer to her bank, but certainly not very often. Consequently, every few months, when they had no money for food, Lee would leave the children with her mother in their small shack in Nong Khai province and take the twelve-hour bus trip to Bangkok, where she would basically sleep on the street, or do whatever she could to find a few customers and earn some money to take back home.
||| Eh bien, les premières étapes du rêve de Lee étaient réalisées : elle avait eu plusieurs aventures au fil des années, si bien qu'à l'âge de 30 ans elle avait quatre enfants, chacun né d'un père différent dont trois étaient occidentaux. Malheureusement pour elle et les enfants, les gars concernés avaient tous disparu de la circulation. Peut-être que certains d'entre eux lui faisaient de temps en temps des transferts d'argent, mais on ne pouvait pas dire que c'était fréquent. En conséquence, tous les deux ou trois mois, quand elle n'avait plus d'argent pour la nourriture, Lee confiait ses enfants à sa mère dans leur petite cabane de la province de Nong Khai, et partait à Bangkok en bus pour, après 12 heures de trajet, pratiquement dormir dans la rue, ou faire tout son possible pour trouver quelques clients et gagner un peu d'argent avant de retourner chez elle.</p>

  <p class="indent">To see a formerly stunning young girl who was once the life and soul of some of the city’s top night spots reduced to almost begging on street corners was a stark reminder of how tough life can be in Thailand, and how fortunes can change. I slipped her a few hundred baht for olds times’ sake, then flagged down a nearby taxi.
||| Voir qu'une jeune fille autrefois pimpante dans les endroits les plus prisés de la nuit soit réduite à la mendicité rappelle durement combien la vie peut être difficile en Thaïlande, et que la chance peut vite tourner. Je lui ai glissé quelques centaines de baht pour les bons moments passés, avant de héler un taxi à proximité.

  <p class="indent">It was just after mid-day when we touched down at Nha Trang airport; a few older outbuildings and a very long runway were clear reminders of who had built the airport. I almost expected a few Vietcong to be sniping at us from up in the hillsides as we disembarked.
|||On a atterri à l'aéroport de Nha Trang en début d'après-midi, dont les vieux bâtiments annexes et une longue piste toute droite rappelaient clairement qui l'avait constuit. Je m'imaginais des Vietcong à flanc de coteau nous tirer dessus pendant le débarquement.</p>

  <p class="indent">I ignored the three-wheeled bicycle taxi <i class="calibre5">(samlors)</i> lined up outside Arrivals, as I needed to stretch my legs and it was only a five-minute walk around the corner to the Dream Hotel. The Dream may not be quite 5-star reverie, but at US$12 a night, it sounded fine to me, and so it proved.
|||J'ai ignoré les vélotaxis <i>(samlors)</i>attendant à l'extérieur des arrivées afin de me dégourdir les jambes, le Dream Hotel n'étant qu'à cinq minutes à pied. Le Dream n'était certes pas un palace, mais à 12 dollars la nuit cela me convenait tout à fait.</p>

  <p class="indent">The first sight of the beautiful Nha Trang beach was quite amazing. I guess I had become too used to the grime of Bangkok, but this Vietnamese location certainly was a lovely seaside resort, fronted by a large theme park, pools and palm trees. I had been hired by a New Zealand insurance company which had a claim from a Vietnamese lady living there against a large amount of gold jewellery bought in Nha Trang that had been stolen. She had provided the insurance company with receipts; my brief was to confirm their authenticity.
|||La découverte de la magnifique plage de Nha Trang m'a laissé stupéfait, elle contrastait avec la crasse de Bangkok à laquelle je m'étais habitué. Mais cet endroit vietnamien était assurément une charmante station balnéaire, bordée par un grand parc à thème, des piscines et des palmiers. J'avais été engagé par une compagnie d'assurance néo-zélandaise qui avait reçu une demande d'indemnisation de la part d'une dame vietnamienne qui logeait là, suite au vol d'une grande quantité de bijoux en or achetés à Nha Trang. Elle avait fourni à la compagnie d'assurance des factures; ma mission consistait à confirmer leur authenticité.</p>

  <p class="indent">I had been put in touch with “Jack”, who just happened to own Jack’s Bar. I soon discovered that Jack’s had a most agreeable happy hour at its rooftop beer garden every evening. Sitting back there looking out over the lush hillsides and sparkling sea, one could hardly believe this had been a war zone just a few decades previously. Jack had also found me an excellent guide. “Mary” was 39, very pleasant, spoke excellent English, and was waiting for her German boyfriend to complete her visa formalities so she could retire to the Rhine. I truly hoped he didn’t let her down, as she was a nice lady.
    ||| J'avais été mis en contact avec "Jack", qui venait juste d'acquérir le Jack's Bar. Je découvris rapidement que le Jack's organisait chaque soir une "happy hour" - heure pendant laquelle les consommations sont à prix réduits - on ne peut plus agréable au jardin du pub sur le toit. Lorqu'on se détendait là-haut en admirant les collines luxuriantes et la mer étincelante, on pouvait difficilement croire que ce lieu avait été une zone de guerre il y a seulement quelques décennies. Jack m'avait aussi trouvé une excellente guide. "Mary" avait 39 ans, était très agréable, parlait un excellent anglais et attendait que son petit ami allemand accomplisse les formalités de visa pour pouvoir s'installer avec lui au bord du Rhin. Je souhaitais sincèrement qu'il ne lui fasse pas faux bond car c'était une dame très gentille.</p>

  <p class="indent">It took a couple of days to get around to all the gold shops I needed to check out in the main part of the town, which was a few miles from the seaside, but it was a straightforward investigation and all the shops I visited were able to confirm that the receipts were indeed valid.
    ||| Il m'a fallu plusieurs jours pour faire le tour de toutes les boutiques d'or du centre-ville dans lesquelles je devais jeter un coup d'oeil, et qui se trouvaient à quelques kilomètres du bord de mer. Néanmoins l'enquête fut aisée et tous les magasins visités me permirent de confirmer la validité des factures.</p>

  <p class="indent">Of course, with the day’s work done, it was only natural that I carried out a little night-time investigating of my own accord, and I was reliably informed that the Sailing Club was the place to go.
    ||| Bien sûr, après cette journée de boulot, il était bien normal que je me livre à une petite enquête de nuit de mon plein gré, et je fus informé de manière fiable que le Club de Voile était l'endroit rêvé où aller.</p>

  <p class="indent">I spurned the offers of numerous motorcycle riders who came alongside me on fake Hondas offering me amazing deals for US$5 as I wandered down to the Sailing Club. But once inside the Club, I was thinking perhaps I shouldn’t have been so hasty with my refusals. The place was almost deserted. If this was the best of Nha Trang nightlife, it was going to be an early evening. The bar manager told me in reasonable English that the weekends were the best time to come, and that girls from the local university often came in. This perked up my interest, until he added that it was currently a term break and most students would have gone back to their homes upcountry.
    ||| J'ai rejeté les sollicitations des nombreux motocyclistes qui roulaient à mes côtés sur de fausses Honda en me faisant des offres incroyables à cinq dollars, pendant que je me rendais tranquillement au Club de Voile. Mais une fois à l'intérieur du Club, j'ai pensé que je n'aurais peut-être pas dû refuser aussi catégoriquement. L'endroit était presque désert. Si c'était là le meilleur de la vie nocturne de Nha Trang, on ne devait être qu'au début de soirée. Le directeur du bar m'apprit dans un anglais acceptable que les week-ends étaient le meilleur moment pour venir, et que les filles de l'université locale venaient souvent. Cela a éveillé mon intérêt, jusqu'à ce qu'il ajoute qu'en cette période de vacances trimestrielles, la plupart des étudiantes étaient sûrement retournées chez elles dans l'arrière-pays.</p>

  <p class="indent">There was an American couple at the bar, so I ended up having a drink with them. I soon found out that Betty and Rory were from San Diego and were not your average backpacker Vietnam tourists or returning Vietnam vets. In their late thirties, they appeared affluent and rather quiet, compared to many Americans I seemed to meet. Rory was in the IT field, and although I didn’t usually offer my profession readily, this time there seemed to be no harm in it. I passed over a card which, I noted, sent Betty’s eyebrows up an inch or two when she read it.
    ||| Il y avait un couple d'Américains au bar, et j'ai fini par prendre un verre avec eux. J'ai vite découvert que Betty et Rory venaient de San Diego et n'étaient pas ces touristes routards ou ces anciens combattants retournés au Vietnam. Vers la fin de la trentaine, ils semblaient riches et plutôt discrets, contrairement à beaucoup d'Américains que j'avais rencontrés de prime abord. Rory travaillait dans le domaine des technologies et de l'information et, même si d'habitude je ne dévoilais pas ma profession facilement, cette fois-ci, il semblait n'y avoir aucun mal. J'ai donné une carte de visite qui, remarquai-je, fit écarquiller les yeux de Betty d'un centimètre ou deux quand elle se mit à la lire.</p>

  <p class="indent">Call it professional instinct, but I always seem to know when a job is in the air. I sensed my new friends might need a little discussion time, so I ordered another round and said I needed a toilet break. Sure enough, when I returned a few moments later, our drinks had been served on a patio table overlooking the water, well away from everyone else. There were a few background questions and the word “discretion” was thrown into the conversation more than once. I assured them I was the soul of that virtue, and added that I was pretty much able to offer suggestions on how anything in the region could be handled.</p>

  <p class="indent">That obviously put them at ease, and so a few minutes later, I got the “We have friends who could need help in a rather delicate matter” gambit – which, of course, meant Betty and Rory themselves. But having already noted Rory’s Gold Amex card, I was happy to sit back and nod my head knowingly.</p>

  <p class="indent">The “friends” were a kind, successful couple who were only missing a baby in their lives, and they had been advised that the woman would be unable to conceive naturally. They had considered various options, and although adoption was a possible solution, that was not always easy. Besides, what they were keen on was possibly finding a surrogate mother. That way, at least one of them would be involved as biological parent. And they had heard that perhaps in Vietnam a willing party could be contacted?</p>

  <p class="indent">I had to think this over, as one can’t rush these things. (Okay, my think lasted about 20 seconds.) I then told them that perhaps they should consider Thailand … Oops, I forgot to say “their friend” should consider it, but it went by unnoticed, as they eagerly asked for more information.</p>

  <p class="indent">The main reason, I said, is that Thailand does not have any law against either parent taking a child out of the country. This is a law that I obviously needed to know, as when one is a private eye based in Bangkok, one does get asked to assist in all sorts of projects. And I mean <i class="calibre5">all</i> sorts – as you will see a little later!</p>

  <p class="indent">Actually, I said, I do perhaps have the ideal person. “What sort of fee were you thinking of?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“We thought US$10,000” said Rory, “plus, of course, all the expenses incurred – lawyers, doctors, hospitals.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Close to half a million Thai baht, I thought, a 10% set-up fee for Mr TPE, and that could leave … mmmmm, let me think… And like a cartoon character with a light bulb beaming over his head, “Lee”, with enough to build a family home and educate her children, flashed for me. I don’t normally like playing God – but it did seem like an opportunity to help a few people in very different parts of the world realize their dreams.</p>

  <p class="indent">I got details from Rory and Betty, and arranged to meet them in Bangkok a few days later, along with Lee and a Thai lawyer. It was agreed that a US$500 upfront fee for locating Lee and setting up the meeting would be paid into my account the next day. (I hoped Lee would still be in Bangkok.) I was becoming rather fond of Nha Trang, although disappointed that none of the local university students were on hand to avail themselves of my charms!</p>

  <p class="indent">Thai girls tend to be pretty much creatures of habit, and sure enough, two nights later I located Lee near her usual corner. “Come into my office,” I said, and escorted her to the nearby Starbucks. There, I clearly outlined what was on my, Rory’s, and Betty’s minds.</p>

  <p class="indent">The mention of half a million baht sent Lee into raptures. That was the sort of windfall you only got by winning the lottery in Thailand. In fact, I’m sure she would have been happy with an offer of far less, but I figured she was due for a change of luck, as, like most of the girls working in Bangkok, she was actually a good person at heart.</p>

  <p class="indent">As far as I am aware, all went according to plan in this instance. I did not get too involved other than appearing at the official meeting and making arrangements for Rory and Betty to rent an apartment in Nong Khai. They had my number and details and promised to keep me posted on how things went. I tend to believe it was just one of those right time-and-place coincidences that seem to abound in Asia, and I was quite happy to wish them all well and move on.</p>

  <p class="indent">My Thai lawyer/fix-it man of course had “friends” who were doctors, interpreters, immigration specialists, nannies, etc, so I’m sure he and his family all made out well out from Rory and Betty, who, I trust, also got what they were after. I never saw Lee back on a Bangkok street corner looking destitute again, so I hope she invested wisely and her family is a little more secure these days.</p>

  <p class="indent">Thais have a phrase which I thought relevant in this situation: <i class="calibre5">wen gum,</i> which basically is the Buddhist equivalent of “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” coupled with “What goes around comes around.” I knew that Lee would not under normal circumstances be able to provide any of her children the type of education and lifestyle Rory and Betty could, and if I had been one of her offspring, I would have jumped at the chance of a life in the West.</p>

  <p class="indent">I did get a few further requests to find surrogate mothers following that encounter; perhaps from word of mouth? It is something that does happen in Asia with a little more regularity than officials possibly let on. But although this episode went smoothly, it was not something I was really comfortable with, so I passed on all further offers.</p>

  <p class="indent">Perhaps it had something to do with that particular month, but soon after this, I also had correspondence with an obviously furtive, older Swiss gentleman who I knew was, as is often the case, only telling me half the story. He questioned me on possible methods of getting back his purported son, who was living with his Thai mother’s family in Chantaburi. As far as I was concerned, It amounted to a basic kidnapping, so although he mentioned very large amounts of francs that could have seen TPE frequenting the more upmarket “Coyote” bars that were springing up all over the city rather than my usual lower-class haunts, that was a step too far – even for me!</p>

  <p class="indent">Suffice it to say that what details I had, I passed on to my friends at Soi Suan Phlu, the address of the Thai Immigration Office. Besides, I seem to have more of an affinity with struggling factory workers and bargirls than the overpaid, over made-up, unappreciative, Hi-So (short for “high society”) play-for-pay girls that were the star attraction at those trendy new Coyote bars with exorbitant prices seemingly aimed mainly at wealthy Asian tourists.</p>

  <p class="indent">In addition to being overpriced, those girls at the Coyote Bars (modelled on the Coyote Ugly movie) very seldom leave with customers, they cannot be bar-fined, though they will give out a phone number and sometimes meet guys outside of working hours – where fees of about ten times the norm are the usual starting point!</p>

  <p class="indent">Most cases involving children tend to be difficult, and I did find myself being asked to participate in such cases more than a few times. Unfortunately, there are those Thai families who basically hold the <i class="calibre5">Luk-Krung</i> (the Thai name given to a child of mixed Thai/Western parentage) to ransom, knowing the child can be the source of a steady cash flow. However, by and large, Thais maintain very close and loving families and typically offer a more stable environment than would the wayward “alleged” father! Indeed, in Thailand, children of a mixed Thai/Western heritage are somewhat revered, and many of the Kingdom’s entertainers, singers, movie stars are all from that type of mixed background.</p>

  <p class="indent">But case of Harry, another client with child troubles, provides a good example of what can go wrong, and it brought a number of difficult situations to the fore. Harry was nothing like my Swiss would-be client, although he did have a similar problem. He worked on an oil rig and consequently earned large amounts of money. He liked to take his R&amp;R in the Land of Smiles, where he obviously became parted from his earnings rather rapidly. I took a call from him one afternoon, and agreed to wander down to meet him at the Silver Dollar Bar in Washington Square where we could have a chat about a little problem he had.</p>

  <p class="indent">Like many of the Silver Dollar’s clientele, Harry had been a regular patron for many years. Most of the Soi Washington bars trace their beginnings, or original owners, back to the days of the Vietnam War R&amp;R, and the clients tend to be not the new-in-town, bargirl-hunting types, but more often than not those that have been there, done that, and are happy to talk about past conquests while steadily consuming Budweiser or Jack Daniels.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was around 3 pm when I opened the door and entered the dimly lit, but (compared to the outside temperature) refreshingly cool Silver Dollar Bar. Young, good-looking bargirls know they have far more chance of making money in the Patpong or Nana complexes, and so it was an older, but nonetheless pleasant bargirl who poured me a JD and coke and pointed to a booth opposite the bar when I asked if Harry was around.</p>

  <p class="indent">Harry was probably pushing fifty and obviously fond of a drink, with the initially reserved demeanour common to most guys spending time on oil rigs or in remote parts of the world. Perhaps he was just a deep thinker, brooding, but it was apparent that something was bothering him, so like any good interrogator, I introduced myself, shook hands, and then sat back enjoying the JD, and waited until he was ready to divulge what was on his mind.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bit by bit, I got Harry’s story. He told me he had been married to a Thai girl for about seven or eight years now and had bought her a nice apartment, not too far from where we were. He didn’t stay there anymore, he said, as they were separated, and he understood there was now a younger German guy in the picture. “Mmmm,” I thought, “a simple surveillance job, just to make sure Harry doesn’t get totally screwed in a divorce proceeding, and that he gets a share of the apartment back.” Wrong again.</p>

  <p class="indent">“She can have the apartment,” he said. “That’s no problem. I’m not short of money; it’s my boy I’m worried about.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Harry went on to say that the main reason he came to Bangkok these days was to see his son and to have a few drinks with some old expat mates. He accepted that as his wife was still young and he was not often around, it was quite on the cards for her to have an affair – and not too big a deal for him. What had happened was that the latest beau was talking about taking her and her son off to live in downtown Berlin. Harry didn’t wish to travel halfway round the world to see his son, or even know if he would be able to see him. And, of course, he also preferred the scenery around the Silver Dollar’s neighbourhood to gazing at the Brandenburg Tor!</p>

  <p class="indent">Obviously, Harry had been a very good provider over the years. As he was somewhat of a loner, there was no one other than his former wife and son to benefit from his high earnings – except perhaps for a few Bangkok bars.</p>

  <p class="indent">The lad had just turned four, he told me, and, in fact, was due to start at Bangkok’s best International School kindergarten when the new term began in a week or two. Almost US$10,000 a year, Harry informed me. “But that’s fine,” he said. “I want him to have a good education and also to speak English.” He noted my eyebrows rise appreciably when he mentioned the yearly fee. “I did call the kindergarten and speak to the principal,” he told me, and it seemed that was the correct rate. But, he was assured, the care, and clientele, were all of the highest standard.</p>

  <p class="indent">I chatted with Harry a bit longer, but it was hard to ascertain just what I could do. Obviously, he was not short of money. (Which, for some reason I could never figure out, was a condition that didn’t normally apply to me!) I suggested therefore that we do some surveillance on his wife, see just what sort of care the child was getting, and also try to get some initial background on the Berlin beau. Harry was more than happy with this suggestion. In fact, most of my clients understood that they were totally in the dark regarding proceedings once they departed the Kingdom, and having a representative on hand that they could call on, or who could update them of goings-on, was usually quite a relief. It was a relief for my landlord, too, of course!</p>

  <p class="indent">A week later, armed with a nice retainer from Harry, I set off early to locate his ex-wife’s apartment, which was in a reasonable block of apartments on a small but pleasant <i class="calibre5">soi</i> off Soi Thonglor. There was a convenient street stall almost opposite where I was able to get a Coke poured into a plastic bag with some ice, and another bag with sliced pineapple, which set me back a whole 20 baht. I then sat down at a little plastic table to await young Simon heading off to pre-school. The school started at 8 am, and the kindergarten was 30 minutes away, so I had arrived shortly after seven. Yet, by 8 am, there was still no sign of Harry’s pride and joy.</p>

  <p class="indent">Whilst spending one’s nights in air-conditioned bars surrounded by nubile young Thai girls is certainly most enjoyable, the hours sitting around in humid, smoggy Bangkok suburbs, sweating profusely and often waiting in vain for an appearance, does not fall into the same level of enjoyment. However, during my days as a private eye, the latter tended to take up far more hours than the former!</p>

  <p class="indent">By 8:30, I had had enough, so I bade farewell to my food supplier and said I might see her again the next day. The following day, the same routine, and the only person getting anything positive out of the exercise was, again, the food seller. Not one to be discouraged, on day three, I was in for the long haul. If it took all day, I was going to wait until I managed to get a look at the former Mrs Harry in the flesh, and, hopefully, young Simon as well. Well, it didn’t take the whole day fortunately, as it was a humid 38 degrees and I doubt I would have lasted that long. Just before 10 am, I saw the pair of them come down to the lobby and walk out, then head up the <i class="calibre5">soi.</i></p>

  <p class="indent">I didn’t need to follow them far, just up a small side lane, and into a nondescript villa that had a small sign outside, in Thai, proclaiming “Pre-School Teaching, 10 am – 3 pm Monday to Friday, 500 baht per week.” Why wasn’t I surprised!</p>

  <p class="indent">I noted down the contact number, then headed back to my apartment. Three early mornings and the heat of the day were getting to me: I needed an afternoon nap and a decent night out at one of the aforementioned bars to get things back to normal. Before dozing off and contemplating which venue I would honour with my presence that evening, I did call the pre-school. I was told that the teacher was very experienced, the wife of a local policeman in fact, and that no, at this stage there was no English included, but for an additional fee it could perhaps be arranged.</p>

  <p class="indent">I was starting to take an active dislike to Harry’s ex, who it seemed was indeed using their child as a means of parting my client from his hard-earned cash in any way she could. I sent a quick email updating Harry on his son’s education, knowing he would be less than impressed, and saying that, in reality, there was not a lot we could do about it.</p>

  <p class="indent">I knew that his wife was a frequent email user, so I asked Harry for the password of the email address he used to contact her, told him I needed it for 24 hours, and he could re-set it again after that. I then made a quick call to my computer wizard friend Jeremy and arranged to meet him in the After School Bar later that evening, and then it was siesta time. (I had developed the rather handy routine for a Bangkok night owl of having a regular afternoon siesta. I figured that as the key targets of many of my investigations, the cute young Thai girls, were generally doing likewise, I might as well join them!)</p>

  <p class="indent">So it was an approaching dusk – or perhaps an unusually heavy smog – that greeted me when I peered through the curtains some hours later. A quick shower had me refreshed and ready for the night’s activities. Jeremy, whom I had arranged to meet, was a rare find, a gem in fact for a struggling private eye. Now, I know how to turn a computer off and on, I even know how to find and scan all types of chatrooms, Matchmaker sites, and how to check an IP address, but that’s about the limit of my IT expertise. Jeremy, on the other hand, was truly a computer whiz. But I’ll tell you a little bit more about Jeremy and my relationship with him later.</p>

  <p class="indent">Jeremy was in the “naughty-boys corner” when I walked into After School at around midnight, with Miss Yu-ee feeding him tequilas with her spare hand. They both gave me a big smile as I entered. <i class="calibre5">“Yu-ee, choke je-arh,”</i> I called out, telling her in her native Khamen that she was having good luck, knowing full well she would be getting a decent tip plus plenty of tequilas out of Jeremy.</p>

  <p class="indent">“No, not me lucky, you friend lucky,” the young girl from Buriram shouted back.</p>

  <p class="indent">By then, I was something of a regular at After School, where the girls believed I worked in the vague field of arranging visas for people! Anyway, on this occasion, it was more about business, at least as far as I was concerned. I extricated one rather large Jeremy from a very small Miss Yu-ee and signalled the girls to give us a break. I passed on the relevant email details I had from Harry, and briefly outlined the case, and the possible plight of Harry and his son. I dug into my wallet for a few thousand baht to give Jeremy for his time, but, great lad that he is, he waved that away.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Just find out the current standing of that new barmaid,” he said.</p>

  <p class="indent">“You’ve been here too long,” I told him. “You’re already able to spot the fresh young girls on the scene.” I didn’t let on to Jeremy that I had already sourced that particular information: the baby-faced barmaid was in fact 32, and had three children back in her village to care for now that her husband had moved on.</p>

  <p class="indent">As it was still relatively early and the After School Bar was somewhat small anyway, there were only a couple of other patrons in the place. So as I was up a few thousand baht thanks to Jeremy’s benevolence, in a rare moment of extravagance, I beckoned Yu-ee over and told her to “ring the bell” – signifying that I was shouting the bar. This was greeted with great excitement in the bar, and, of course, it all helped build up the questionable image of what a great guy I really was.</p>

  <p class="indent">But back to our story: Even allowing for the generous bell-ringer’s tab, I figured I was still well in front. I went and got my own refill from the new barmaid, and mentioned to her that my friend Jeremy was even more <i class="calibre5">jai dee</i> than I. (Jai <i class="calibre5">dee</i> is usually translated as “good-hearted”, although as far as bargirls are concerned, the term rather suggests someone who is a “soft touch”.) What’s more, I added, he was very interested in her. By this stage, smiles were beaming all over the place, and there was lots of clinking of glasses and shouts of <i class="calibre5">“Choke dee</i>!” (Good luck!); in other words, the camaraderie of a Bangkok bar at its best !</p>

  <p class="indent">It was three days before Jeremy got back to me. Apparently, a certain barmaid had taken up all of his attention in the interim. However, I gathered that the six letters he mentioned (ZZZZZZ) referred to Harry’s ex-wife’s email and her password and not to his own need for more sleep. (Although he certainly sounded like he could use some additional sleep.) It’s quite amazing, the simple passwords chosen by many of the people I investigated. Still, I was sure Harry would be pleased with the result, and that he was getting better value for his money from me than he was from what he was lavishing on his son’s current education fund.</p>

  <p class="indent">I went online and spent an hour or two browsing the estranged Mrs Harry’s email, thankful that a trait of many Thai girls is not to delete mail. (I guess they think it’s handy to have all correspondence on hand, just to remind themselves what they have actually said at times – or is that just my cynical beliefs surfacing again?)</p>

  <p class="indent">There were a number of emails to various gentlemen with Western addresses, for the majority of whom, it seemed, contact had come via some of the many online matchmaker sites that she obviously belonged to. Of late, however, it was clear that the main man was certainly one Herr Rick Loppitz of Altenburg, Germany, and that the prospects of Harry’s former wife and son heading Westward were indeed very real, whereas a certain David, from Brighton in the UK, seemed destined to be passed over. (Fortunately for David, I thought.)</p>

  <p class="indent">I noted Herr Ricks email address, and put that to one side. I did wonder how he would react to an unsolicited email from an unknown Bangkok private eye. I would need to word it carefully, but in most cases, I found those involved in Thai intrigues at any level were happy to receive all kinds of information on mutual acquaintances residing in the Land of Smiles!</p>

  <p class="indent">I gave the case some thought; foremost in my mind was the well-being of Harry’s son, and in this respect, it was also a matter of taking the long view. I decided that before contacting Herr Rick, I would check out some facts and figures with the local German embassy. So the following day, I made a trip to Sathorn Road.</p>

  <p class="indent">What I saw gave me a little jolt: it was perhaps the largest single gathering of obviously “night-working” Thai girls I had seen out anywhere during daylight hours! The fact that most of them seemed totally bored, and obviously would have preferred to be in their rooms asleep rather than waiting for visas or interviews, didn’t seem to be registering on the infatuated males they were with, who were no doubt contemplating a home back in <i class="calibre5">Deutschland</i> with their <i class="calibre5">Liebchen.</i> Cynic that I am, I was sure the ladies were at the same time contemplating a new home for the family in Ban Nok (upcountry Thailand) or whether that month’s payment from other various “sponsors” had arrived!</p>

  <p class="indent">I had dealt with the German embassy a few times before, so I knew who to ask for, and by and large the German bureaucrats there were more helpful than their US or British counterparts; perhaps the fact that Koh Samui was often known as “Little Frankfurt” had something to do with it!</p>

  <p class="indent">Jürgen motioned me into a side room a few moments after I had asked for my card to be presented to him.</p>

  <p class="indent">As he was relatively young for a diplomat, I doubted Jürgen was corruptible, but, like all of his kind, he was always keen to catch up on any local gossip, so I passed on a few titbits about one or two of his countrymen and then raised the question of Harry’s son perhaps becoming a future German citizen. Jürgen agreed it could be a possibility, but assured me that for now, a three-month tourist visa was all that would be forthcoming. He made the necessary note, along with my contact details as the boy’s father’s representative.</p>

  <p class="indent">The next step was to email the German boyfriend. As mentioned, I never knew how these third-party contacts would react, but by and large, I found most people I dealt with pretty reasonable, and keen for knowledge on their current lover. In this case, as expected, German common sense prevailed.</p>

  <p class="indent">As was my style – or should I say, vindictive nature? – I didn’t spare Herr Rick too many details. I told him I was acting for Harry; that is, Harry who had just paid nearly half a million baht for his son’s education for the year and found the boy was instead attending a 500 baht-a-week cheap local establishment. I mentioned Harry’s natural concern, adding that he did not want to lose contact with the lad and was worried he might end up in Altenburg, or – and yes, I just couldn’t help myself – Brighton.</p>

  <p class="indent">The reply from Rick was almost instantaneous. No questions about how I had his email address, but “what was this about Brighton?”. Rick himself had been led to believe that the boy’s father had died and left a poor, grieving wife struggling to bring up the lad as best she could!</p>

  <p class="indent">I sent him back a copy of the transaction Harry had made to his ex-wife’s account for school fees, assured him Harry was alive and well, then told him David of Brighton was also a “friend” of the lovely former Mrs Harry and that my contact in the German embassy would be closely monitoring any visa applications. Rick, sensible German that he was, then emailed me back asking for suggestions as to how to proceed, so I filled him in on the Thai P4P system, explained that this was basically the category his beloved fit into, and that he would be well-advised to keep to that sort of arrangement as far as she was concerned. Pay her for her time if you come to visit her; otherwise, put her, and her demands, out of your mind, I advised.</p>

  <p class="indent">I then assured Rick that regardless of what she had threatened to do, when she learned a trip with Lufthansa was now unlikely, she would remain in contact – and be at the airport to meet him anytime her presence was requested! Standard Thai “P4P girl” practice was to never completely cut ties with a past sponsor.</p>

  <p class="indent">Rick emailed me back a few times, thanking me for the advice, and advising me that things had gone exactly as I’d predicted. So, for the time being, crisis averted. The final step was to pay the lovely lady in question a visit.</p>

  <p class="indent">I arranged for Sakdah, one of my Thai part-time helpers who ran a small travel agency but gave the impression of being a very serious and senior official, to accompany me. Most Asians are aware that serious fraud officers, and other high-ranking enforcement people, always go about in plainclothes, so they often have more respect for them than the uniformed kind. We were let into a typical Thai apartment, clean and tidy, with a large photo of King Rama V on the wall – although none of Harry that I could see!</p>

  <p class="indent">I walked straight over to a small coffee table and laid down a copy of the school fee transaction Harry had made, a photo of her and her son coming out of the nearby Thai pre-school, as well as an admissions application for the high-priced kindergarten.</p>

  <p class="indent">“I am investigating a fraud charge,” I told her in Thai, and nodded towards Sakdah, who stood there with an official-looking notebook in his hand.</p>

  <p class="indent">“My friends in the American and German embassies are asking questions about you,” I told her, and added that local people were wondering if she was fit to take care of her son!</p>

  <p class="indent">Anger, shock, amazement registered in her face, all at the one time. I knew better than to try and argue or reason with a Thai woman. I simply held up a hand to silence her and said, “Have the boy enrolled in the correct school tomorrow and no further action will be taken. Also see that he is ALWAYS available to meet his father when requested.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“By the way,” I added as I headed for the door, “neither the German nor British embassy intend to grant you a visa.” Well, yes, I was taking liberties, but as far as I was concerned, she had well overstepped the mark in regards to the boy’s education and, consequently, his possible future. Perhaps the reality, or shock, of what she had done or been discovered doing sunk in, as there was no sound or attempted explanation from her. I motioned for Sakdah to exit, and we quickly left the building before she thought to ask for some ID, or even ask a few relevant questions of us. My idea had been to shock her into doing the right thing; considering that she was from a fairly humble background, I thought it had a good chance of working.</p>

  <p class="indent">I then contacted Harry, and we discussed all that had happened. He understood that in future, he would be best off making any such payments directly to the school. As I gather, he did have to slightly “replenish” the preschool fund, but I was able to report a week or two later that the boy was indeed attending the much higher-class establishment.</p>

  <p class="indent">Of course, not all cases get so neatly finalized. One other case that comes to mind started with an email I received from a former US Army soldier who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer.</p>

  <p class="indent">He had been in Bangkok some 30 years earlier and had an affair with a Thai girl. The girl had become pregnant, he had covered initial expenses, but then returned to the States and had had no further contact.</p>

  <p class="indent">He forwarded me an address, and a Thai family name, and although I was able to locate the house, there was no knowledge of the woman or child. There was little more I could do, but I pointed out that once a Thai woman has crossed what is quite a substantial line, to have an affair with a <i class="calibre5">farang</i> or foreigner, they will in most cases continue down that path. (Whether this is because they are then shunned by Thai men, or genuinely do wish to have a Western husband, depends on the particular woman involved.) Quite possibly, I suggested, this ex-GI’s former girlfriend and child had ended up living a comfortable life in a foreign country. I never did hear back from him, so that was one more case that slid into the unsolved basket.</p>

  <p class="indent">A postscript: Certainly cases involving children, such as maintenance deals, visitation rights and DNA tests, did come our way from time to time. This was especially true for children of mixed heritage. As you can imagine, when the parents have gone their separate ways, and that extends to separate continents, it can make things especially stressful or difficult for all concerned.</p>

  <p class="indent">Obviously, there is no easy answer. However I would like to point out that, from a personal viewpoint, Thai women, regardless of their background or upbringing, tend to make wonderful mothers. Indeed, in more cases than not, I have seen the birth of a Thai-Western child strongly cement a relationship.</p>

  <p class="indent">Oh yes, I had promised to explain how computer whiz Jeremy and I had come to such a pleasant working relationship. It seems that Jeremy had developed some arcane piece of software a few years back and received a very, very large payout from some Silicon Valley outfit. He had then flown to Bangkok to meet up with a “movie star” he had met online, who hadn’t looked quite so angelic or pale-skinned in the flesh. (Amazing what the photo shops in the cut-rate Marboonkrong shopping complex can do to enhance pictures.) However, as Jeremy was hardly movie star material himself (unless you were casting an overweight, dishevelled nerd), he didn’t notice. He was ecstatic just to have a girlfriend of any type, let alone a young and relatively good-looking one. She was also very understanding and let Jeremy have lots of time to himself at night to do his computer browsing, which is how he stumbled across a local chat site where some kind soul had had a nice word to say about TPE.</p>

  <p class="indent">I had met Jeremy at a nearby Starbucks, and soon had his life story, and also a look at a handful of pictures of his beloved, who I instantly knew was not, as she had informed him, going home at night to care for her sick grandmother.</p>

  <p class="indent">I advised him to invest in a new mobile phone for Miss Du and, before giving it to her, to install a very handy system we had access to. Jeremy had insisted on paying me a full day’s rate for our little chat and advice, so, of course, I told him to call me anytime he had a problem. I hadn’t expected that to be the same evening, but he called me around 10 pm, most apologetic about the hour.</p>

  <p class="indent">“That’s okay,” I had told him. I was just starting out on my nightly rounds, which meant going to my regular footpath venue, on Soi 13, sitting on a plastic stool and eating satay chicken washed down with <i class="calibre5">Sangthip,</i> a cheap Thai rice whisky popular with those who can’t afford Johnny Black.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was too early for the local talent parade to start passing my prime spot, strategically situated between the Soi Cowboy and Nana entertainment plazas, so I told him I would be at the Emporium Suites shortly, and a five-minute motorcycle taxi ride had me at his trendy abode.</p>

  <p class="indent">I learnt how excited Du had been with her new phone, and how, as normal, she had left the apartment a couple of hours earlier, so as to get home before it got late and Grandma got worried. Shortly thereafter, Jeremy had logged onto the site our spyware connected to, which very conveniently records all text messages sent and received by that phone. There had been plenty of action, although most of it was in Thai script. I wouldn’t say I’m foolproof in reading Thai, but I do get by okay. In any case, with this one, it was pretty hard to mistake the CM2!</p>

  <p class="indent">Miss Du had apparently decided to leave her sick grandmother on her own for the evening whilst she visited a popular nightclub and well-known pick-up joint called CM Square. I told Jeremy it might be best if I went over there to follow up and had hardly been able to mention that a few expenses might be incurred before he had thrust five 1000 baht notes in my hand. Hence, soon thereafter, I had happily upgraded my plastic stool on the footpath in the humid, smog-laden Bangkok air for a padded one at the delightfully air-cooled CM Square nightclub.</p>

  <p class="indent">Spotting a reasonable-looking Thai girl, late twenties, with long black hair and probably dressed in trendy Levis with a small, tight-fitting T-shirt in CM Square was as easy as finding a needle in a haystack. However, as per usual, I had asked Jeremy to detail any recent jewellery he had bought his lady, as it was fairly certain this would be flashed for all and sundry to see. Sure enough, an hour and three JD-and-Cokes later, an overlarge gold bracelet with dangling hearts confirmed that I had located the lovely Miss Du.</p>

  <p class="indent">She was with three friends, and it was quite obvious who was paying. Indirectly, of course, it was poor Jeremy! In any group of trendy Thai girls, there always seems to be least one girl who currently has a sponsor and is able to pay the taxi and entrance fees, not to mention a round or two of drinks. Pay, that is, until one of the many circling “sprats” – who mistakenly believe they are sharks – gets pulled into the net to take over the night’s payments.</p>

  <p class="indent">Suffice it to say, Miss Du was very much a player. I didn’t even need to resort to using one of my younger, better-looking associates to effect a sting. A few days later, I had Jeremy perched up in the balcony of the Marriott Hotel, seeing his beloved, ostensibly at home caring for Grandma, saunter in to meet up with a guy she believed to be a very wealthy and famous Australian movie producer, who in reality was a struggling Kiwi private eye. As a result, Ms Du lost a very good sponsor, and I gained an invaluable ally in the IT field.</p>

  <p class="indent">To say invaluable was, in fact, doing Jeremy a disservice: In most cases, all he needed was an email address, and preferably the email address of a contact known to the person you were checking on, and there was little he couldn’t find out about the unsuspecting person’s on-line activities.</p>

  <p class="indent">Of course, the big plus for struggling TPE was that Jeremy was very rich and loved being involved. Hence, a few drinks at a – yes, I admit it – “sleazy” bar and getting me to give a quick assessment of his possible night’s companion was more than enough payment for him. As you can see from the above story concerning Harry and his son.</p>
