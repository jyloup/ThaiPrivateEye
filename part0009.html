  <p class="noindent">The events that shocked the world on December 26<sup class="calibre6">th</sup>, 2004 were indeed horrific.</p>

  <p class="indent">However, for those actually involved, or based at the time in Phuket or Koh Phi Phi as some of our staff were, they were obviously far worse. These colleagues were confronted daily by distraught or grieving families and faced particularly stressful situations on all fronts.</p>

  <p class="indent">One thing that especially saddened me was the many “unknowns” who disappeared on that fateful day – the many itinerant traders one sees at tourist or holiday resorts all over Thailand. These included peanut sellers who may have fled across the border from Burma, trying to eke out a better living for their families; those from Thailand’s poor northeast, who may have left behind arid farmland to cook food at street stalls; and yes, even those working in prostitution, who were no longer young or assured of clients. All these types, along with the drunk, drugged and disorderly, would more often than not sleep on the beach or under a nearby palm. They were of no fixed abode, short on friends, and perhaps long out of contact with family. Many of these people were never seen or heard from again.</p>

  <p class="indent">Thai Private Eye has several operatives based in Phuket, and I am proud of the fact that during this difficult time, we were amongst the first to offer humanitarian aid and to assist the local authorities in any manner that we could. Obviously, in the aftermath of the tsunami, we did get called upon to perform an investigative role. One rather intriguing case that I personally looked into did not come to my notice until quite some time after the actual tsunami.</p>

  <p class="indent">I was approached by May, a very well-educated, attractive Thai woman in her mid-thirties.</p>

  <p class="indent">She told me that a mutual friend had recommended me. In this case, it involved someone who is, I must admit, a rare breed in my circle of friends: that is, another Thai woman who was likewise from a very well-educated and respected Thai family.</p>

  <p class="indent">May began by filling me in on some of her background. She had, like her brothers, attended medical school, and whilst they had gone on to become doctors, she had ventured into the beautician business. There had been an affair with a Thai doctor, but like many successful Thai men surrounded by opportunity, he had proven to be <i class="calibre5">jow shu</i> (a playboy)</p>

  <p class="indent">May had then immersed herself in her work and, in fact, was at the forefront of various new techniques in the cosmetic world. She had an idea of maybe opening a chain of specialized clinics. However, although her family was well-off, they were perhaps not quite that affluent. It was around that time that she had met Rodney. The quintessential British expat, he oozed charm, money and breeding, all assets that appealed greatly to an upper-class Thai woman such as May.</p>

  <p class="indent">They had met in Phuket, where May operated a clinic, at the high point of the resort’s social calendar, the Royal Regatta. Rodney was, in fact, the owner of one of the larger yachts moored at the local Yacht Club. He also owned a villa nearby that he used when he was in Phuket. Whilst perhaps not a match made in heaven, it was nonetheless a very compatible coupling. May was very much at home in the high society circles Rodney moved in, and for his part, he had an attractive and well-respected partner.</p>

  <p class="indent">Over the next few years, May had two children with Rodney; nannies, housekeepers, and, later, private schools were, of course, no problem for this high-powered couple. Rodney spent much of his time overseas, as he had offices in Spain and the Cayman Islands. As far as May was aware, her significant other was involved in international real estate. But, as is often the case with Thai women, she did not ask too many questions and was not totally sure of just what he actually did.</p>

  <p class="indent">May knew, however, that he was very rich: he provided her with whatever she or their children needed, and he allowed her plenty of space to continue with her interest in the cosmetic world. In pursuing these interests, May moved regularly between her Bangkok home and clinic, her Phuket clinic and their villa. By and large, all was well in her life.</p>

  <p class="indent">Towards the end of 2004, Rodney’s visits to Thailand became far less frequent. However, he had assured May he would be there for Christmas and New Year. True to his word, Rodney had flown into Bangkok a day or two before Christmas and had caught up with his wife and family, although to May, it was obvious they were drifting apart. Rodney said he wanted to catch up with some friends in Phuket, so he flew south, and May was to travel down with the children a few days later so they could spend New Year together. That was the last time she or her children ever saw him.</p>

  <p class="indent">Unable to contact him by phone, with the whole region in turmoil, May had gone south as soon as she could. The villa was still standing, but only just: it was no longer inhabitable. As to Rodney, there was no sign whatsoever. She spent a rather traumatic few weeks checking unidentified bodies that had been recovered, but none of them was Rodney.</p>

  <p class="indent">She tried to contact the few members of his family she knew or had heard about and received either no answer, a wrong number, or no comment. The British embassy took notes, but little else.</p>

  <p class="indent">She stayed on in Phuket for six months. A small payment from the Thai government, as a partial compensation for loss of home, did not go far, and the land eventually reverted to the Thai state. Private school, nanny and living expenses soon depleted the bank accounts, whilst tourists or locals in need of beauty treatment were no longer plentiful. Finally, May had to leave Phuket, resigned to the fact her husband was probably dead, and return to her family home in Bangkok.</p>

  <p class="indent">She knew Rodney was rich and assumed some provision would have been made for her and the children, but she had limited knowledge of his private affairs, and all enquiries she made quickly hit a brick wall. It was frustrating, but in true Thai manner, she learned to accept adversity, and not to question authority. She accepted her lot, conceded that the good times were over and that now she had to struggle, work hard, and try to raise and educate her children as best she could. Certainly, it would not be too hard for them, as her family was wealthy and she was again in demand in the beautician field. So gradually the past and the horror of what had happened at Phuket faded, and she moved on with her life.</p>

  <p class="indent">Part and parcel of Thai life are regular visits to a fortune teller, or <i class="calibre5">mor dhu,</i> as they are known locally. From the humble bargirl to the Kingdom’s leading politicians, all will make regular trips to those they believe are the more astute amongst the soothsayers, especially if some major change to their circumstances seems “on the cards”, so to speak. They often make important decisions based on the <i class="calibre5">mor dhu</i>’s recommendations.</p>

  <p class="indent">May was no different, and although not as firm a believer in fortune-telling as many, she did make the occasional visit. On one such visit, something stuck in her mind: the <i class="calibre5">mor dhu</i> had repeated that “your husband has left you.” Perhaps that was the catalyst, along with that suggestion from our mutual friend that she really should look into any possible inheritance for her children.</p>

  <p class="indent">There certainly seemed to be a few strange twists and turns to her tale. For instance, why Rodney’s relatives would not at least be in touch seemed surprising, although I figured it was also quite likely, considering his constant travelling, that Rodney perhaps still had a wife back in the UK, and that his Thai family was something of a secret. It certainly wouldn’t be the first time I had encountered that scenario.</p>

  <p class="indent">I asked her to find all the names and paperwork relating to her husband she could, and she suggested I call around to her home the following evening when she would be able to show me everything that could be relevant. No doubt at all, May would have been a stunner in her younger days, and unlike a lot of Thai women, she was ageing particularly well, probably much better than me, I thought! So I told her I looked forward to seeing her again.</p>

  <p class="indent">The three-storey townhouse was in a modern block at Bangna. I often enjoyed travelling out to the suburbs, where a Westerner was a rarity and you got a far better perspective of how the majority of Bangkok’s ten million inhabitants go about their daily lives.</p>

  <p class="indent">The air-conditioned home and May’s lingering perfume (Fendi, I suspected) together provided a</p>

  <p class="indent">welcoming greeting as I stepped inside. I wondered if the perfume was for my benefit; certainly, the lovely, well-educated, successful and hard-working May would be a step up from my usual female acquaintances – although, upon further reflection, I’d have to say she’d be perhaps a step too far!</p>

  <p class="indent">May took out a large manila folder that contained various papers, photos, and documentation, so I spent some time identifying various people in pictures and getting what information I could about her somewhat shady (or at least, low-profile) husband’s past. One did not usually spend so much time away from one’s family, especially if your wife was a gem such as May. For that matter, one usually didn’t have an office on the Cayman Islands without having something to hide, I figured.</p>

  <p class="indent">An hour later, armed with the manila folder, a few pages of notes in my trusty notebook, and a fond farewell, I was in a taxi and heading back to my apartment to start some research into the mysterious Rodney. I was unsure as to just whether the delightful May needed some physical consoling along with my professional help. But knowing Thais and the class system that operates there as well I do, the realist in me understood that her manner was that of the normal, well brought-up, polite and affable Thai woman and that my focus would have to remain fairly much on the missing husband rather than his wife!</p>

  <p class="indent">As our Phuket office had worked closely with local police and government departments involved in the tsunami disaster, I did have a number of contacts I could easily get in touch with, but neither they nor the British embassy had any knowledge of Rodney’s demise. As May had done, I tried to contact the members of her husband’s family she knew of, but in most cases, the numbers were old or had changed, or else I got a short “I have no idea what happened to him.”</p>

  <p class="indent">By this time, over two years had passed since the tsunami, and although, as I mentioned, many itinerant workers may have been lost without a trace, it became increasingly obvious to me that someone who was British and wealthy would not have died in that disaster with absolutely no recognition, death notice, or at least a remembrance service. I felt the answers lay in the UK, more than likely in the form of another family, or perhaps a demanding wife that May had been blissfully unaware of. Unfortunately, May’s budget would not cover a trip to “Old Blighty”, so I continued to work mainly through the documentation and papers she had provided me with.</p>

  <p class="indent">Buried somewhere in all this was an old letter from the lovely people at Royal Orchid, the frequent- flyer arm of Thai Airways. Having contacts within major airlines is, of course, imperative in the private eye business. Admittedly, tapping such contacts is perhaps not ethical … but hey, we are talking about Thailand, and fortunately, as far as I was concerned, people in the region were far more influenced by money than by things like privacy laws!</p>

  <p class="indent">The following day I made a trip down Vipharvadi-Rangsit to the Thai Airways head office, and went to find Frank. Frank was conveniently in his office and at his computer terminal, although I noted it was on <a href="http://Ladbrokes.com">Ladbrokes.com</a> rather than on anything connected with the airline!</p>

  <p class="indent">Frank and I discussed the relative merits of Arsenal and Manchester United for a few minutes before I slipped him an envelope containing a few thousand baht and Rodney’s frequent flyer number written on the outside. “You want print-out, Khun Warren?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="indent">A few minutes later I was in a taxi, heading back to my apartment with full details of Rodney’s flights over the past five years folded up in my shirt pocket, along with an assurance that Arsenal would win the Premiership that year. (Man U actually took the title.)</p>

  <p class="indent">Rodney certainly had racked up the miles; he was a Gold Card member, and always flew business class. Bangkok, Heathrow and the Caymans featured prominently, particularly in the earlier days. However, it was when I got to the last page that I did a double-take: Rodney had flown Lufthansa to Malaga on the Costa del Sol just three weeks earlier! Thanks to German efficiency, and an airline co-op deal known as the Star Alliance, the good people at Lufthansa had transferred his air points to his Thai Airways card.</p>

  <p class="indent">Now either someone was using Rodney’s ID or credit card, or Rodney himself had changed his Thai <i class="calibre5">te ruk</i> (Thai term of affection, meaning “my love” or “my darling”) for a Spanish senorita. In view of the heightened security arrangements at airports these days, I clearly opted for the latter explanation.</p>

  <p class="indent">As transnational crime becomes perhaps the major problem facing enforcement agencies worldwide, co-operation amongst various agencies, including Interpol obviously, is becoming increasingly important. Unfortunately for a struggling Bangkok private eye, however, access to these types of files and the departments involved is not as easy as it is to many other organizations within the Kingdom. I thought that perhaps May should go to the local fraud office, and from there the international, inter-agency information that we wanted might become available. But working through those official channels is a very slow and drawn-out process, and May’s attitude was that in her mind, Rodney was dead and gone, and that’s how she wanted it to stay. The notion that, not so much she herself, but the couple’s children had been abandoned by their father was just something she couldn’t, or didn’t want to, contemplate.</p>

  <p class="indent">So although I had just about confirmed that he was indeed still alive, and she had asked me to dig up a little more information as to the reasons for his disappearance, she was not keen to get involved with Interpol or to make too big a fuss. This, by the way, is fairly much the Thai attitude in such cases. I had a good look through the wide range of contacts and clients I had built up over the years, and there were one or two in fairly strategic positions of law enforcement that I was able to call on to look a little further into this mystery man.</p>

  <p class="indent">What I was finally able to put together was that Rodney had operated an international real estate business that seemed to specialize in selling overpriced properties to the rich and gullible.</p>

  <p class="indent">It also seemed that selling the same property to two or three clients was not an unknown practice in this field, and, of course, beachfront villas in places like Phuket had also been sold to Western clients blissfully unaware that in Thailand not only are foreigners unable to buy land, but they cannot even buy a home.</p>

  <p class="indent">(Thai law states that land is owned by the King, although often that land is on a 100-year lease. In true Thai style, there is a loophole regarding ownership of a dwelling: provided that an apartment or condominium block is 60% Thai-owned, single units within that structure may be owned by foreigners, but they cannot own a stand-alone dwelling.)</p>

  <p class="indent">The Internet being what it is, with chat rooms and the like, disgruntled clients tend to communicate with each other. Consequently, news of some of the companies Rodney was associated with, and their dubious dealings, had begun to surface. A number of lawsuits were pending, Interpol had indeed been alerted, some bank accounts had been frozen, and bankruptcy <i class="calibre5">cum</i> incarceration was looming large for Rodney. Then, out of the blue, the tsunami had not only given him a chance to escape, but also to cover up some of the very suspect deals he was currently involved in regarding the sale of Phuket villas.</p>

  <p class="indent">In the turmoil surrounding the tsunami and its aftermath, it had been rather simple to pick up a friend’s passport and jump on a bus to Penang in Malaysia. From there, with enough money, boarding a ship bound for almost any part of the world would not have been not too difficult either. As Rodney had family members in the UK who were also involved in the land deal scams, they had covered up for him and, of course, were sworn to complete secrecy.</p>

  <p class="indent">Just how a man could, overnight, disassociate himself from his own children is something that neither May not I could ever figure out; nonetheless, that was the path Rodney had chosen.</p>

  <p class="indent">For her part, May was deeply shocked by the turn of events, but decided to keep to her original belief, that her husband was lost in the tsunami. She did, however, decide to take a leaf from his book in one respect and accept an offer to transfer her beautician skills abroad: she has now relocated her family and likewise started a new life. In her case, thankfully, it is legal and successful. More, unlike her “late husband” Rodney, she doesn’t have to look over her shoulder day and night.</p>
