  <p class="noindent">For more than a decade, private detective Warren Olson worked the bars and back alleys of Bangkok. Fluent in Thai and Khamen, he was able to go where other private eyes feared to tread. Although Olson has since retired from the PI scene and has returned to his native New Zealand, the company he founded in Bangkok, Thai Private Eye, is still open for business (<a class="calibre5" href="http://www.thaiprivateeye">www.thaiprivateeye.com</a>).</p>

  <p class="indent">Olson, who holds a Masters in Strategic Studies, is the co-author of <i class="calibre5">Confessions of a Bangkok Private Eye,</i> his first collection of case files from Thailand.</p>
