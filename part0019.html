  <p class="noindent">It had not been a particularly good month for the team at Thai Private Eye. Certainly in a business such as ours, things do not always go to plan or run smoothly. We had literally just run full smack into the consequences of taking on a job where the client had not passed on all relevant information to us, and even worse, was not in full possession of all the facts himself.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Singaporean had seen his Thai girlfriend disappear a few months earlier and had just about exhausted all avenues of finding or contacting her himself, when she was seen by a friend of his. Adding to the drama, she was seen in a department store maternity shop and it was very obvious she was shopping for herself. Desperate not only to contact her, but to get her back to Singapore, where he assumed maternity hospitals would provide better care for their soon-to-be-born child, he enlisted our help. Oh, he somehow forgot to tell us that she had deliberately avoided his own efforts to contact her recently, and, oh yes, he also failed to inform us that her previous boyfriend was a very experienced Thai kick boxer! Little details like that do help our investigations.</p>

  <p class="indent">Add to this the facts (that we were not aware of until too late) that the kick boxer knew about Mr Singapore’s efforts to contact the girl and had told him to keep clear or else and that, rather than being an “ex” boyfriend, it was he who was the child’s actual father. You can get some idea of the disaster our agents sailed into. Suffice it to say, we had some rather badly beaten agents to care for and were not at all happy with Mr Singapore. Consequently, we now are extremely careful in accepting any cases that we believe we have not been fully briefed on.</p>

  <p class="indent">The job request we received a few days later from an elderly European, however, did seem relatively straightforward and perhaps offered us a chance to give our agents a safe and injury-free assignment. Of course, just what the connection was between an elderly, quiet, reserved, and extremely wealthy Belgian gentleman and a “wanna-be-rich” middle-aged Macau expat playboy was something that would only be revealed in the fullness of time.</p>

  <p class="indent">Edmond was wealthy; not just rich, he was obscenely rich. The owner of a successful Brussels-based electronics company, he was now semi-retired, and one of his hobbies had been surfing the Net, and in particular, some Asian dating sites. It was through this dubious medium that he had come across the vivacious Miss Angelina.</p>

  <p class="indent">(How dubious a medium, you ask. The case of the Internet scammer, detailed in my <i class="calibre5">Confessions of a Bangkok Private Eye</i> gives an in-depth look at how some people online differ greatly from their site profile – not only in looks, but often in age and gender as well!)</p>

  <p class="indent">An accurate description of Angelina would run something along these lines: age 31, born in Bangkok; mother, Thai, father, allegedly American; occupation, actress /gold-digger. She could also lay claim to the very dangerous attributes of brains, beauty, patience, and, of course, greed. Again, just like Edmond, it was sometime into the investigation before we were fully aware of all these facts.</p>

  <p class="indent">Having jetted out to Bangkok to meet the lovely Angelina, and finding that in this case, rather surprisingly to us, that she did indeed exist and in the flesh was actually fairly much like her stunning online profile, Edmond had then spent the next two years showering her with gifts, gold, money, and trips all around Europe and Asia. He also had financially supported her supposed acting career and even thrown in the obligatory car for her and a new home for Momma. They were – well, better make that Edmond was – in love. She had met his friends and family, including his daughters, who were about her own age, and by that point, Edmond was sure she was perfect wife material.</p>

  <p class="indent">It’s at that time that our patient gold-digger goes for the jugular and tells Edmond to forward funds for their future dream mansion. And believe me, even in Thailand, dream mansions overlooking the Andaman Sea do not come cheap.</p>

  <p class="indent">The exceptionally large transfer of funds was made, and Edmond was happy to do so as they were going into a joint account for the home that he believed would be held jointly in their names. Well, dear reader, hazard a guess as to what happens next? Amazing, you must be psychic!</p>

  <p class="indent">It wasn’t long before both the funds and the lovely Angelina seemingly disappeared into oblivion. It was at this stage that Edmond contacted us, not worried about his missing money, but to try and ascertain what had happened to his beloved. He feared she may have been in an accident, or perhaps robbed and beaten by the estate agent! As he relayed the whole story to us, he did mention the odd time when Angelina had gone missing in the past for a week or two. Allegedly, she was on photo shoots in remote locations. There was also the occasional phone call late at night, or taken out of his hearing, that he assured us were work-related, and it became obvious that this was a carefully planned and well-executed scam on her part. That is, obvious to us anyway!</p>

  <p class="indent">Edmond, of course, was still not convinced Angelina would have set him up in such a way, so as the “customer is always right”, we agreed with him and treated this as a missing persons case, rather than a huge missing money scam on a rich old gentleman by a smart, attractive girl!</p>

  <p class="indent">We went through the motions of checking local hospitals, with the suspected negative result, then had a police contact check files to see if any arrest or felony had been reported involving her; again, nothing was found. That, of course, left another department and other contacts to chat with, where we finally met with some success. The lady in question had indeed departed the Kingdom, just a few days after Edmond’s substantial transfer had been completed, and taken the night flight direct to Macau. According to our information (and yes, we have to keep some secrets as to how we obtain all our material), she was staying at the famed Lisboa Hotel.</p>

  <p class="indent">Edmond was then called and updated. As the investigation was still ongoing, and mindful of the problems our agents had only recently encountered, he was informed that she was in Macau, but we didn’t at that stage pass on the name of the hotel we believed she was staying at. Edmond would undoubtedly have called the hotel, or probably flown out in a private jet, and could have compromised the case. We simply asked if he wanted us to continue and perhaps gather some photographic evidence. Not in a great frame of mind to begin with, he understandably was not too pleased with our findings. At first, he accused us of lying about locating her. We countered by offering to happily continue the investigation and pledged we would either get hard evidence for him within 48 hours or refund his retainer.</p>

  <p class="indent">A now somewhat subdued client agreed that we should continue, and a further payment for expenses was immediately forwarded to us from Brussels. We had two agents heading for Macau later that evening. Although a large and bustling hotel, the Lisboa has only one major breakfast or 24-hour coffee shop. It was there the following morning that our alert team was well-positioned to scope out the scene. For a time, they just sat, amused by the range of Chinese and Russian prostitutes parading past, trying to snare clients on their way to the downstairs casino, or perhaps to catch one of the few winners on his way out. Then one member of the team spotted Angelina with some guy whom we soon learnt was Shane, an Australian professional gambler. Not so actively involved in casino games of chance, he apparently did considerably better at the Macau and Hong Kong racetracks than most.</p>

  <p class="indent">Looking like a honeymoon couple, it was quite obvious Shane and Angelina were not in some platonic relationship. We could only surmise that in the upstairs suite where they spent most of their time, the form Shane was studying closely was not just that of thoroughbreds. Mind you, one has to concede that in the world of gold-diggers and scam artists, Angelina was something of a champion. Our agents did not have to spend long in the hotel to get a number of pictures of an apparently very loving couple. For his part, Shane was much closer to Angelina’s age, and a late-night drinking and dancing session at the nearby Fortuna nightclub provided more evidence of them both having a good time, in a manner that was well past Edmond’s current physical capabilities.</p>

  <p class="indent">Our agents emailed a number of pics back to the Bangkok office, one showing that day’s <i class="calibre5">China Post</i> very prominently, and these were, in turn, forwarded on to Edmond.</p>

  <p class="indent">Our information was that Angelina would not be returning to Bangkok for some time, wise girl that she was. However, Edmond advised us that he was on his way to the Kingdom and asked whether we could meet him at the airport, so we could go through all the details and, in his words, “help sort this out”. It’s not our normal procedure to meet clients this way, but Edmond had spent a fair amount of money with us to date.</p>

  <p class="indent">Moreover, we did have some concerns for his safety, especially as he had made mention to us that Angelina had recently told him she had some powerful connections in the Thai police force. This was more likely a calculated bluff on her part to keep him from trying to track her down after she had worked her scam. But in view of the recent events and confrontations our agents had faced, we were not going to take any chances. She would know that Edmond had the funds to mount a very serious hunt for her, and with the cash she now had at her disposal, getting someone to protect her, or harm him, would likewise not be too difficult.</p>

  <p class="indent">We met the rather gaunt, sombre Edmond as arranged, and accompanied him to the Hyatt. Once he had checked in, we adjourned to his suite and went over all details we had gathered to date. He still did not totally accept that he had been taken for a first-class ride; he felt there were unknown pressures or circumstances that had forced Angelina to act the way she did. However, our agent’s reports from Macau and accompanying photographs proved that she was under no duress whilst with her Australian roommate, and they were quite obviously comfortable together. It was then that we pointed to those times she was out of contact, took secretive phone calls, or made reference to various events or alleged photo shoots, some that we had since confirmed never took place. Bit by bit, Edmond then recalled numerous other questionable happenings during the relationship.</p>

  <p class="indent">By the time we left him, he was resigned to the fact that perhaps we were right, and his mood of concern and worry was about due to be replaced by anger and good old lust for revenge! He called us the next morning. (No doubt it had been a restless night for the man from Brussels.) He wanted us to track her down with a team of our special bodyguards on hand. The cost, he repeatedly informed us, was no object. We pointed out that she would more than likely have bodyguards herself, and that as foreigners, even with our contacts, a confrontation at the airport, or anywhere in Thailand for that matter, was something we were never going to win. We also advised him that as far as we were aware, she had moved from Macau to Hong Kong, and had no bookings to return anytime soon to the Land of Smiles.</p>

  <p class="indent">In the end, Edmond agreed to leave the matter with us. We would keep the case open and advise him if and when we learnt of her whereabouts. But for the time being, that was as far as we would go. When we called back to his suite later that night, he had already checked out, obviously not in any mood to bother about making further acquaintances with Thai women.</p>

  <p class="indent">I know, it’s becoming repetitive, but it’s a fact: Bangkok is a very small place. Either that, or the gods there enjoy playing the fate and coincidence cards. About a week after Edmond’s departure, we received an email from Hong Kong. A certain Australian gentleman was asking about our services, with an eye to running a background check on a young Thai lady who just happened to go by the name of Angelina!</p>

  <p class="indent">Edmond was, to all intents and purposes, still our client, and although we struggled with the coincidence of it all, and in fact wondered at first if it was some kind of set up instigated by the Brussels gentleman himself, we ran our own checks and found we were indeed dealing with a now Hong Kong-based, “ow-yah-goin-mate” Aussie.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cautiously asking for a little more detail as to the type of information he was after, we were told it was basically a financial and credibility check. The woman in question had shown him a suitcase containing “a helluva lot of cash” and was asking him to match it as an investment based around the production of a new Thai movie. The money was to be deposited in a joint account, and yes, that account would be in a Thai bank. Obviously, our little scammer was out to double her holdings. I spent a day or two trying to figure out how we could possibly scam the scammer, but just ended up with a headache.</p>

  <p class="indent">In the end, I went with the easiest option, and accepted a nice little <i class="calibre5">gratis</i> payment from both Edmond and Shane. What for, you may ask? Simple: introducing them to each other.</p>
