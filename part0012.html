  <p class="noindent">As the new management gradually took over, a number of changes became necessary.</p>

  <p class="indent">A lot more staff, or operatives as we call them, were put on the payroll. Each case was given a number, and usually three or four operatives were assigned to each individual job, which was run by a case manager or “Control”, often the Company Director, who coordinated movements from the central Bangkok office. An early case that indicates how things work resulted from an email received from Mary, a resident of the Big Apple. (New York, of course; is there any other Big Apple?) It was apparent that her “Chubby Hubby” as he soon became known, was no longer the big apple of her eye!</p>

  <p class="indent">Mary had concerns over the frequent business trips her spouse and a business partner had been making to Asia and wondered if perhaps he was being unfaithful. As one of our agents remarked, “She may have just as well asked us if McDonalds was still selling Big Macs.”</p>

  <p class="indent">A standard questionnaire was emailed to Mary, and shortly thereafter, we had all the information required, including flight details and a picture of the big man himself. “BIG” certainly was the operative word: our quarry was bordering on morbidly obese. Six-foot-six and festooned with a number of tattoos: it was obvious that identifying this man was certainly not going to be a problem.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mary’s request was for photographic and, if possible, video evidence as proof of infidelity, for if her suspicions were confirmed, she planned to confront him and file for divorce.</p>

  <p class="indent">As you can well imagine, in a city such as Bangkok, with over ten million people and chaotic traffic, following subjects is not always as simple as it appears in the movies. With that in mind, we always try to cover all possible angles. In this case then, three agents were allocated to handle what we called the “Chubby Hubby” case. After all, we wanted to maintain our good reputation as we are well aware of what damage any smallish company can suffer from a bad report on a website or bitter exchanges in a chatroom. We did not wish to join Chubby Hubby on Mary’s list of serious disappointments.</p>

  <p class="indent">Agent #1 was stationed in the arrival hall; his task was to identify the subject, then follow him and get details of the taxi or mini-van he hired to take him into the city. At this stage, Agent #2, waiting in a nearby vehicle, would take over and follow the target to his hotel, which we had been informed was the Radisson, one that offered very reasonable rates for such a fine establishment. A possible reason for this is that it is some distance from the popular red-light districts. Many people making hotel bookings online don’t realize the average travel time around Bangkok is 5 km per hour. We were fairly confident that Chubby Hubby would be taking another lengthy taxi ride shortly after he checked in. Agent #3 then was stationed in the Radisson Hotel lobby, slowly perusing the Bangkok <i class="calibre5">Post.</i></p>

  <p class="indent">It was not difficult for Agent #1 to spot what resembled a slow-moving hippo making its way through the throngs at the Arrivals gate some time after Flight TG 791 from New York had landed. As Mary had indicated, out target had a travelling companion, only slightly slimmer and with a shining, billiard-ball head. Spotting our pair in the local bars or clubs amongst mostly petite Thais did not seem like it was going to present any major problem.</p>

  <p class="indent">About that time, our agent had a smug little smile on his face, content in the knowledge he had the quarry in sight, he knew his movements, and all was well in investigation land. That, however, is just about the time when things can start to turn to custard! Was this about to happen yet again? The pair of intrepid businessmen did not waddle towards the taxi queue or appear to have a welcome sign and courtesy vehicle from the Radisson on hand. Instead, they started the slow trek along the walkway signposted “Domestic”</p>

  <p class="indent">Agent #1 hurriedly called into Control, who instructed him to follow the pair discreetly and then advised Agents #2 and #3 to stand by. Finally, the two arrivals from New York exited the walkway and headed for the Business Class check-in at Bangkok Airways, where a sign proclaimed “Koh Samui -40 flights daily”. Koh Samui is an idyllic island just off the Thai coastline, an hour’s flight from Bangkok.</p>

  <p class="indent">So much for the best-laid plans – and typical of the type of thing that can go wrong, no matter how well prepared you may be. Agent #1 notified Control, who asked him to get a couple of pictures of the pair and to also confirm the Samui flight number and see that the subjects made it on board. Agents #2 and #3 were told to stand down, and a hurried call was made to an operative we had stationed on Koh Samui. Fortunately, it was not around the time of the full moon or he may well have been plunked on the outer island of Phangnan, along with a few thousand backpackers, doing his imitation of Leonardo Di Caprio in <i class="calibre5">The Beach.</i></p>

  <p class="indent">One thing was very clear, however: this certainly was no business trip, although that had been a foregone conclusion. Mary was quickly updated as to the change in situation, and advised that expenses might add up. She was not at all pleased to learn of Chubby’s change of schedule, or that additional costs would be incurred. However, she gave the go-ahead to continue the assignment. It was made very clear to her not to make mention of Koh Samui should Hubbby call her; amazing how many clients just can’t help themselves at times, and totally endanger operations. More on that later!</p>

  <p class="indent">Our Koh Samui agent got a rushed briefing. It was not quite an hour’s flight to the tiny island paradise which locals have nicknamed “Little Frankfurt”, such is its popularity with Germans.</p>

  <p class="indent">Our local operative arrived at the quaint airport nestled amongst the palm trees just as the flight was taxiing to the terminal. Without bothering to dismount from his trendy Phantom Honda 200cc, he soon spotted the wayward travellers. Most travel around the island is by way of motorcycle, or little taxi vans that have been designed to carry 45-kilogram Thais. All the huffing and puffing that Chubby and his friend took to get on board meant our agent could hardly miss them!</p>

  <p class="indent">The agent followed the taxi van at a distance, and watched as most of the passengers alighted at various hotels and along the popular Chaweng beach area. Finally, only the two heavyweights remained in the back, and the little van chugged further along the island ring road, eventually pulling into a rather isolated but exclusive resort in the next, somewhat smaller bay, appropriately known as Chaweng Noi, or little Chaweneg.</p>

  <p class="indent">Our local agent was on good terms with almost every receptionist in the area; well, certainly the good-looking ones, so it was a simple matter to confirm that the two were booked in for a week, and that, in fact, they were in Rooms 102 and 103, poolside on the ground floor.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sure that they were not going far for some time, he got back to Control with the details, and showing the initiative we try to install in our operatives, was able to add that Rooms 207 to 209 were opposite on a higher level, with a very nice view of the entrances to Rooms 102 and 103.</p>

  <p class="indent">A reservation was made, and the very lucky Agent #1, having already sighted the plump pair at the airport, was told he would be able to swap his rather seedy apartment in Bangkok’s Pratunam district temporarily for Room 208 at a luxury resort on Koh Samui.</p>

  <p class="indent">Agent #1 arrived at the Koh Samui resort the following day, and was met by our local operative, who took him to the resort and supplied him with some high-definition cameras and videos.</p>

  <p class="indent">Upmarket resort that it was, it featured dark-tinted windows, perhaps to lessen the heat, but, of course, ideal for our purposes as well. Things were all going to plan; for us, anyway!</p>

  <p class="indent">The best method of transport around Samui is motorcycle; however, the little Honda models for rent everywhere were not suitable for Chubby and his friend, who were reduced to travelling in the taxi trucks. This, of course, made tracking them fairly simple, especially as our Samui man knew the entire island so well. With Agent #1 as the video-shooting pillion passenger, ample footage of the ample pair cavorting with local girls in bars around Chaweng and Lamai was soon obtained.</p>

  <p class="indent">On a couple of occasions, Chubby even obliged by bringing girls back to his room for the night; although in one instance, the word “girl” had to be seriously questioned. Transvestites (or, as they are known locally, <i class="calibre5">katooeys)</i> abound on Samui. However, according to our agents, Chubby had most likely overlooked the larger feet, hands, and protruding Adam’s apple, as he remained totally focused on a very impressive pair of silicone-filled breasts.</p>

  <p class="indent">Chubby’s new friend’s prominent mammaries were, no doubt, courtesy of one of the many Bangkok clinics that specialize in cosmetic surgery. Just how much surgery the sexually reconfigured Thai male had undergone we shall never know, but certainly, on this occasion anyway, he/she was not hurriedly sent packing by a suddenly very embarrassed client!</p>

  <p class="indent">The choice of that particular overnight companion was also something of a bonus for our cameraman. Unlike their genuine female counterparts, who even though, admittedly usually in a drunken or drug-induced haze, seem happy to dance naked around silver poles in bars, most Thai girls will revert to being shy and demure out in public or in a hotel environment. Thailand’s lady-boys, however, are normally very extroverted. Extra short and/or tight-fitting is their preferred mode of dress, and, of course, they are not at all shy about showing off their silicone-enhanced assets.</p>

  <p class="indent">All this made the footage of the loving couple in Room 103 having a poolside breakfast so much easier to obtain. That spectacle sort of resembled a whale devouring plankton, and was certainly going to go down well with Mary’s lawyers, although we thought it perhaps wise for all concerned not to bring the gender of his companion into the equation at this point.</p>

  <p class="indent">Our agents also obtained some receipts from a rubbish bin outside the Bangkok Bank’s Chaweng Beach ATM machine after the target had made a withdrawal, to further confirm his whereabouts. In addition, courtesy of the resort’s night manager (who had unfortunately invested his last week’s wages on a below-par Arsenal that had gone down to the Spurs), they were able to get a copy of his bill that included breakfasts for two, extensive mini-bar usage, and a number of spicy Thai snacks that had been charged to his room.</p>

  <p class="indent">All the evidence was then compiled on a DVD and couriered to Mary before the hard-working businessman returned home. She, and no doubt her lawyers too, were very happy with the result, and obviously her Chubby Hubby had a lot more to think about on his return than lithe Thai bodies and Koh Samui’s nightlife and resorts.</p>

  <p class="indent">As is often the case, it appears our “interfering” had not gone down well with the wayward hippo, as shortly afterwards, we received another email, allegedly from Mary, but strangely enough, the sentences and grammar were somewhat different in style, as was the IP address.</p>

  <p class="indent">Supposedly, our deeply satisfied client was going on a world tour, and would be in Bangkok for a day or two. She would like to personally thank us and hand over a bonus; could we arrange to meet her?</p>

  <p class="indent">A quick courtesy call confirmed Mary had no intentions of setting foot anywhere on the Asian continent. Control then sent a very nice reply, reminding “Mary” of our security services if she needed them, attaching the pictures of some of our Thai team whose kick-boxing prowess made Jean-Claude van Damme in his prime look about as lethal as a stunned mullet.</p>

  <p class="indent">Suspecting that Chubby perhaps had some rather pernicious thoughts in mind for TPE (and yes, there are some very vindictive people out there, again something we will come to shortly), Control couldn’t help but add a little “P.S.” to the email. It read, “It was indeed sad to discover your husband’s sexual preferences have changed. I suppose a reason for his booking into such a secluded resort was this penchant he has developed for young males and transvestites.”</p>

  <p class="indent">For some reason, we never got a reply to this message or heard from the sender again.</p>
