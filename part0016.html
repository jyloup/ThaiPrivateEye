  <p class="center">“The House always wins”</p>

  <p class="center1">Las Vegas maxim</p>

  <p class="noindent">Once again, it had appeared to be a fairly straightforward case. Okay, a straightforward needle-in-a-haystack case, but the type we get on a surprisingly regular basis. Knowing I had been involved in this type of scenario many times, the appointed case control officer gave me a quick call and asked for a few suggestions. He noted it was the type of case where his area of expertise – surveillance technology, listening, tracking, shooting videos – did not appear to be of much use. He was to be proven very wrong in that respect, but that was all to come later.</p>

  <p class="indent">Martin had called the company after we had been recommended by a friend of his who had used our services not long before. An American, Martin was domiciled in Kuwait. Although we never asked, and he never volunteered the information, it was more than likely he was perhaps there on behalf of Uncle Sam. We did learn he was middle-aged, presentable, single, and well- off!</p>

  <p class="indent">As a number of his compatriots have done over the years, he often spent his R&amp;R in the Land of Smiles. The network of US expats is pretty strong in Bangkok, and getting good advice on where to go, who to ask for, and how much to pay is all readily available. Martin was a Thai girl’s dream in a number of ways – American, unattached, good job and not tight with his money – but up till then, he had avoided the pitfalls of a permanent relationship with a Thai lass; not that he was averse to them in any way. He had the usual little black book full of Thai mobile numbers and a sprinkling of demimondaines’ email addresses he had bothered to keep. Hence, it was not usually any problem to have a friendly acquaintance knocking on his hotel door shortly after he had checked in to his normal haunt, the Landmark, a better-class hotel. For his wants and needs, the Landmark was ideally located close to both Nana Plaza and the many nefarious Sukhumvit Road watering holes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Martin asked if we could perhaps drop by the Landmark and have a chat. Not our usual procedure, but as he was guaranteed by a former good client and he stressed that it was an urgent matter, we made an exception.</p>

  <p class="indent">He explained to the appointed case controller that he had been in the downstairs pub of the Landmark, a fairly high-class establishment as far as watering holes in that area go. A Thai girl had been sitting nearby for some time, gazing blankly at an empty bottle of Singha Beer. He had asked her if she would like a refill, and thus he had come to meet Ree. He had sensed something of himself in Miss Ree (short for her full name, Areerat, she had told him), who it seemed was something of a loner and a bit of a lost soul. She was 26, dressed in designer jeans and T-shirt, no make-up, obviously not desperate to find a provider for the night, and said she was actually just waiting for her friend, who had a short time before gone upstairs to visit someone.</p>

  <p class="indent">Her English was not too bad, she admitted to some time in Singapore and Malaysia, and quite refreshingly didn’t have tales of a sick grandmother’s dying buffalo or numerous siblings to support. Over the next few hours, and a number of drinks, Martin learnt she had two older brothers – one a builder, one in the army – her parents had a small banana plantation in Ratchaburi, and she had come to Bangkok about a year ago to complete a hairdressing course. She also admitted to Martin that she sometimes forgot to attend said course.</p>

  <p class="indent">They had ended up spending the remainder of his sojourn together, and Martin, even with his extensive experience with Thai ladies of the night, admitted he was completely smitten with the demure Miss Ree, her perfect body, and her remarkable prowess between the sheets!</p>

  <p class="indent">They spent most of the remainder of his stay together. Some new clothes, meals, and an ample supply of drinks was all he was asked for, which, not surprisingly, endeared her to him even more. There were no demands for money, no disappearing at odd hours to satisfy husbands or other sponsors, no secretive phone calls. What’s more, Ree had an easy-going attitude and was happy to go wherever or do whatever Martin wanted. In other words, she was the ideal companion, and he was about ready to throw his little black book of other contacts into the rubbish bin. He bought her a gold bracelet and had to force US$1,000 into the back pocket of her designer jeans on the day he had to sadly return to Kuwait. And that wasn’t just because they were so tight-fitting!</p>

  <p class="indent">Back at work, Martin called her almost daily. On a couple of occasions she had sounded drunk, but said the reason was that she was sad and missed him. At other times, there was talk in the background, just her roommates playing cards supposedly, and, in fact, she had put some of them on the phone. All seemed fine then, and there was even talk of a trip to meet her family in Ratchaburi.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was only two days before he was due to return to Bangkok that suddenly all contact was lost. The adage that absence makes the heart grow fonder had become quite pertinent in Martin’s case: he was really looking forward to his return and wondering if, in fact, this relationship might well develop into something more permanent.</p>

  <p class="indent">He realized there was no doubt a lot about Ree he didn’t know, and obviously she had some “skeletons in the closet”. She did get depressed at times, often tried to drown her sorrows, and he figured the local <i class="calibre5">yaa baa</i> form of methamphetamine was something that she probably was not a complete stranger to. However, he still found it hard to fathom why she was suddenly incommunicado.</p>

  <p class="indent">The only point of contact he had, apart from her mobile phone which now gave a recorded message in Thai saying the number was no longer operative, was the room she told him she shared at a well- known, dilapidated and definitely dodgy Phetchburi Road apartment block. He had taken her there one time to get some clothes, and, perhaps as he was trained to do in such circumstances, had made a note of the building name and room number.</p>

  <p class="indent">He remembered a rather grandiose name, not entirely fitting for the large apartment blocks grouped together that house hundreds of bargirls, karaoke and massage parlour workers, along with Nigerian scammers, hard-up English teachers and assorted other hangers-on and wannabes. It had been late evening when Martin arrived back in Bangkok, so he had gone straight to the apartment block. After a little trial and error, he had found room 616. However, the door was locked, and there was no sign of life. He had returned the next morning and managed to rouse a couple of sleepy Thai girls in the room who would only say “Ree gone” and made it clear that was the end of the conversation. It was at this stage that Martin had called us and asked help in finding his missing love.</p>

  <p class="indent">Allowing that he really knew little of her background and had even less to go on as to her possible whereabouts, he understood Miss Ree might well be a lost cause, in more ways than one. However, Martin was not short of money and he didn’t like unsolved mysteries. Perhaps he had just met her when she was between sponsors, or had had an argument with her husband; a slew of possibilities suggested themselves. However, he felt he knew her well enough that these were not too likely, or else she was a very good actor. He also worried that something more serious may have happened to her and felt he at least owed it to her, and himself, to try and delve a little deeper into her disappearance.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Phetchburi Road apartments seemed the only lead, so that’s where, the following day, two of our agents headed in search of Room 616 and some possible answers. Agent #1 in this case was one of our best Thai female operatives. Some years back, she had had a sponsor or two herself; however, these days she was happily married to one of our staff. With training, she had adapted remarkably to the investigative role, and her understanding of many situations from the Thai female perspective was often invaluable.</p>

  <p class="indent">As a cover story, a Western Union sticker was placed on her jacket and some of the company’s forms put on a clipboard that she carried in a shoulder bag along with a video cam. She also had a recording device and a buttonhole cam: quite the walking advert for high tech equipment.</p>

  <p class="indent">Agent #2, in the guise of her motorcycle taxi driver, set off with her to the apartment block, which was well known to us from various investigations over the years. We never send an agent out alone and always try to have a plausible cover story for them. Of course, we knew that Western Union is not in the door-to-door delivery business, but this is a ruse that Thais of the background we were dealing with would not question, especially if money was purportedly headed for someone in their group! They soon found their way to room 616. Shoes outside the door and some muffled sounds from within that a small sound amplifier the size of a pack of cigarettes held briefly and carefully against the door, identified as small talk and card shuffling confirmed that the room was certainly occupied now.</p>

  <p class="indent">Unusually, however, the door was shut, a careful turn on the doorknob signified it was locked, and even the cockroach entry under the doorway had been blocked by a towel. In those type of apartments, where humidity is high and air-conditioners rare, it is normal for Thai occupants who are at home and awake to leave the door and windows open to help air circulate. Locking the door and blocking it tends to signify those within are probably up to no good! Perhaps just playing cards for money, which although it comes in only slightly behind eating and TV watching as favourite Thai pastimes, still happens to be illegal. (This, incidentally, is a law that has proved a boon for the boys in brown, the Thai police uniform colour, as any time they uncover a game, they can automatically confiscate any monies found on the premises!)</p>

  <p class="indent">Although games are often played for a few baht, stakes can, of course, climb much higher in what is normally a form of poker. Another reason for secrecy, and perhaps even more common in these dodgy apartments, is that drugs are present in the room.</p>

  <p class="indent">After much whispering and shuffling, the door was finally opened a fraction. Agent #1 pointed to her Western Union stuck-on logo, waved her clipboard, and said she had a contact notice for room 616. We were safe to assume that some, if not all those present, would have at some time received payments via the international money transfer agents. And, of course, any mention of money opens doors in most places, especially Bangkok. Given that slight opening, our agent was quickly inside. She deftly placed her camera-carrying bag on a table, making sure it was directed at the five or six girls still sitting in a semi-circle on the floor.</p>

  <p class="indent">She then consulted her clipboard and asked for Miss Areerat – only to be told she was not there. But the room’s owner, who gave her name as Mam, assured our agent that she could represent her “relation”. Mam, late fifties, dripping with gold, and sporting blonde streaks in her hair that looked like they had been applied by a blind man with a paintbrush, was obviously in charge of the group. Just as clearly, she was a former lady of the night herself, who, like many of her ilk, didn’t realize, or admit to knowing, that she was well past her sell-by date.</p>

  <p class="indent">Not missing a beat, Agent #1 then asked for some ID. She noted Mam’s details, which she wisely figured might come in handy, and explained the reason for her visit, saying the sender had paid an extra fee to confirm the address of the person receiving the money. She said this also involved reminding the beneficiary that if the money was not collected personally within a week, the funds would be returned to the sender.</p>

  <p class="indent">“We normally phone,” she told Mam, “but the number we were given seems out of order.” Mam assured her she would try and get the message to Areerat, and made it clear the conversation was over. Picking up her bag, our agent quickly left the building with Agent #2 before those in the card game had any second thoughts.</p>

  <p class="indent">Agents #1 and #2 were then stood down from the assignment, and agents #3 and #4 brought into the office. Middle-aged Thai men, one doubled as a taxi driver, the other had been a fairly handy kick-boxer in his day; in fact, he was still handy in the present day! They both sat down with the appointed case controller and watched the video of the girls in the room over and over, along with descriptions given by the previous two agents.</p>

  <p class="indent">A set of reasonable pictures was made and transferred to their mobile phones, and they were then sent to spend the rest of the day (and night, if need be) eating and drinking at the tables scattered outside the small food-stalls that served the inhabitants of the dingy apartments. Their task was to identify one of the girls from room 616, preferably one who appeared to perhaps have lost her money or been sent out as the lowly food collector.</p>

  <p class="indent">Apart from Mam, it was probable that most of those present when our agent visited would be susceptible to a little pressure and some money and would then perhaps divulge more about Ree’s disappearance. Our female agent, who was not often wrong in such situations, believed Ms Mam was hiding a lot more than she was letting on.</p>

  <p class="indent">Control had meanwhile updated the client and asked him to go to the nearest Western Union office and send his beloved a small amount, but to make sure the transaction was tracked, an often useful service offered by the money transfer company, as it provides a way to check a girl’s whereabouts. The sender is then able to log on and find out when and where a payment is collected.</p>

  <p class="indent">Meanwhile, our agents had settled down to some snack food and chat outside the apartments. It was not too many hours later that an opportunity arose: an elderly Thai lady, wheeling a trolley and ringing a small bell, wandered up the alleyway between the apartment blocks, and our agents identified a girl from the video who was approaching the hawker. She went to purchase some grasshoppers fried in oil, a favourite amongst many Thais. Noting that the young lady only bought a small amount and used loose change rather than notes to pay, our agents decided the girl seemed a likely candidate for bribing, so when she took her small bag of food and headed slowly towards another of the dingy blocks, the agents casually followed here.</p>

  <p class="indent">Agent #3 was able to get in the lift with the target, and saw her press Level 4, so he pressed Level 2 for himself and quickly text-messaged a “Four” to his co-agent, who was already in the building stairwell. Our man in the lift then cursed loudly that he had made a mistake with Floor 2, he really wanted Floor 3. Having already slowed the lift down, he then bent over in the lift doorway when it reached the 3<sup class="calibre6">rd</sup> floor, spending a moment to do up his shoelace – and also to have a good look at the girl’s footwear. By the time the lift finally reached Level 4, our second agent was sitting on the window ledge at the end of the hallway, apparently having a somewhat heated discussion with his wife on his mobile phone which in actual fact was off, although the video camera therein was certainly on.</p>

  <p class="indent">The hallway lighting was not great, but certainly good enough to identify the subject and see her take her shoes off, shoes the agent from the lift was also able to confirm as hers. There were no other shoes outside at that point. More important for our team, she had used a key to open the door to Apartment 402 rather than knocking. It did indeed seem that she was on her own, so the agents called into Control with an update on the situation and suggested it might be just the time to take a chance and call on her.</p>

  <p class="indent">Control gave me a quick call, reminding me that these days, impersonating various officials is much more of a no-no. After some discussion, knowing most girls in those apartments don’t spend much time in rooms alone, we decided to approach her immediately.</p>

  <p class="indent">The simplest plan was then to have our Thai agents basically tell the truth. No need to mention who had engaged them, but just say that they had been hired to track down Ree, and were able to offer a reward for helpful information; said information would, of course, remain strictly confidential. As a month’s rent at the apartments is around 5000 baht, that was the sum we decided to offer if the girl could indeed shed any light on the subject.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was almost midnight when Agent #3, toting a few cans of beer, and agent #4, prominently displaying five crisp, white 1,000-baht notes, knocked on the door of Apartment 402. A few moments later, they were greeted by the somewhat bloodshot eyes of a rather plain and tired-looking Thai girl who, they estimated, was in her late twenties. She peered at them through the gap of the door held by a safety chain.</p>

  <p class="indent">Thai women on their own, especially in these apartments, are not in any hurry to allow men into their rooms, so the money and beer were quickly produced and a calm and quiet explanation of what they were interested in was given.</p>

  <p class="indent">The money was waved: “This is for just having a little chat with us” they said, whilst swearing they were not police but investigators just making some simple enquiries, and anything she told them would be kept totally confidential. As she hesitated, they continued to wave the money. Finally, the safety chain was unhooked and a girl who gave her name as “Gay” (although seemingly anything but) cautiously beckoned them in.</p>

  <p class="indent">It took some time, and another trip downstairs for some food and more beer, before they made real progress. Our agents do not generally drink on the job, but it is part of Thai culture that food and drink go together with any lengthy conversation. It had quickly become apparent that their approach to Gay had been timely: not only was she broke and desperate, but she did have useful information to pass on as well. To keep the conversation rolling along as smoothly as was the small digital voice recorder Agent # 3 had casually placed on the table, extra drink and an extra 1000 baht note were offered … and quickly accepted.</p>

  <p class="indent">All our agents are instructed in effective interview or interrogation procedures. It is, in fact, a field I personally specialize in these days. It is amazing just how much personal and often unsolicited information you can obtain by asking open-ended questions, usually about side issues such as family or hometown, by not interrupting and giving the subjects as long as they want to talk or answer. Having a good supply of food and drink on hand also helps in these procedures.</p>

  <p class="indent">We were lucky on this occasion. Gay proved to be the ideal choice: she was desperate, under a lot of pressure, and had no one to talk to. The agents had to listen to her own problems first, listen to her justify in her own mind taking the money and passing on information, but they had been taught that by being patient, generally the truth will out.</p>

  <p class="indent">Gay told them she was four months pregnant and no longer went to work at a popular bar and pool room where she had met her Swiss boyfriend almost a year earlier. When she became pregnant, the boyfriend had asked her to stay home and rest, and he sent her plenty of money for food and rent each month while he was, for the time being, hard at work back in the land of the watchmakers. It was obvious that most of the money went to card games, as there was very little food in the room, and Gay was quick to eat the snack food provided.</p>

  <p class="indent">Gay then asked one of those vague questions that perhaps only a Thai girl being in the company of apparently wise and knowledgeable investigators would ask. “Can you test for a baby’s colour?” This is what I mean by letting a subject chat away and all sorts of information can surface! Reassured everything discussed was totally confidential, Gay mentioned that around the time she became pregnant, there had been an occasion with one of the Thai motorcycle taxi riders who she had an on-again-off-again affair with for years. In addition to that dalliance, when very drunk one night, having lost the month’s rent money playing cards, she had ventured into the room of a nice Nigerian man downstairs. Whether the baby would be fair, olive or dark-skinned, seemed to be very much in question! Perhaps we would be getting a call from Switzerland in five months time!</p>

  <p class="indent">Gay certainly had her own problems. Gradually, however, with some more food and beer, the conversation was carefully steered around to Ree and her mysterious disappearance.</p>

  <p class="indent">Backing up Martin’s testimony, Gay told them Ree did not have any close friends or family. She knew her from playing cards together in Mam’s room and was also sure that Ree and Mam sometimes did some sort of business together. What followed then was quite a tale, and certainly altered the course, degree of difficulty, and the danger of finding Martin’s lost love.</p>

  <p class="indent">What the agents related when back at the office, confirmed with the tape recording, was the following: Mam, the older woman from Room 616, nowadays made her money mostly by introducing younger girls from upcountry to various bars and massage parlours around the city. She also acted as a go-between for a Malay syndicate which ran various activities in Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. These, we came to learn, included illicit casino operations, along with the usual sidelines: a ready supply of drugs, prostitution and pornography.</p>

  <p class="indent">Gay hadn’t known Mam all that long, but understood Ree was perhaps one of her earlier inductees into this type of lifestyle. Gay herself had only met Ree recently, after she had apparently returned from a three-month spell at Singapore’s well-known night-time haunt, Orchard Towers. Gay then went on to relate how Ree had told her she made a lot of money in Singapore, although it was also clear that the biggest part of this had been absorbed by agent’s fees, commissions, and, of course, drugs, to which Ree was apparently addicted. She still, however, had enough money left to go often with Mam to the “casino”, as Gay called it.</p>

  <p class="indent">These “casinos” are normally just a house or apartment where various card games and other forms of gambling are run illicitly. Gay had been there once or twice when she had money and knew it was in the Suttisan district, about a 30-minute taxi trip away, but she did not recall exactly where. In any case, being an illegal den, apparently backed by Malaysian interests, it would be well-protected one way or another. Without the means to gamble “big time”, the girls would play for small amounts in Mam’s apartment. Ree had soon lost her earnings but had recently come into money again – no doubt, Martin’s parting gift. That had allowed Ree to again accompany Mam to the “casino”, where she had soon lost her latest windfall as well.</p>

  <p class="indent">Gay’s narrative then got very interesting: As she now had boasted of a “rich sponsor” and also was happy to work in Singapore or Malaysia, it was easy for Ree to gamble at the casino on credit, Gay mentioned. She had heard Ree was now in debt to the syndicate. Obviously too embarrassed to ask, or even unsure if Martin would bail her out, Ree apparently learned that the syndicate were about to make a new run of pornographic movies and had asked Mam to find some suitable actors. Mam had put forward a distant relation from her own village who was very pretty but also drug-addicted and in dire need of money. Now, with the set-up complete, they had Ree available to make up the duet.</p>

  <p class="indent">The pair had travelled south by train a few days previously and were now in Malaysia. Gay knew this for sure, as the girls had called Mam earlier in the day, when Gay herself was there playing cards, to say they had arrived and were okay. They had mentioned they were staying at a nice hotel and expected to be back in a week or so, well cashed up! As far as Gay could recall, contact details, or at least a phone number that Mam had written down on the back of a playing card was behind a fridge magnet in room 616.</p>

  <p class="indent">Following the agents’ debriefing, Martin was contacted, and we discussed what further action could be taken. Our initial thought was to offer Gay another payment, then return to Mam’s apartment and get the contact information. If the phone number there was indeed a Malaysian landline, we could soon track down the location. That, of course, would not be of much help, especially if it was a secure room. What’s more, previous escapades south of the Thai border had alerted me to the fact that corruption and the carrying of guns were widespread there, especially in certain provinces. But Martin assured us that now he had started, he wanted to see this thing through. He was incensed to learn that this sweet young girl he was infatuated with had perhaps been forced into making pornographic movies. It had become something of a personal mission for him to right any wrong.</p>

  <p class="indent">We agreed to see if Gay could get us the number and to look at further options if she was successful. Gay was then asked to do so. Upon being told it would involve a nice bonus for her, she assured us it would be no problem. Loyalty is generally not a strong suit amongst Thai girls, or at least those women working in the night trades.</p>

  <p class="indent">It is always a problem using people in this manner, and something we try to avoid if possible. When we need to rely upon a usually nervous and untrained person, it often seems that if something can go wrong, it will. But in this case, we had little choice, as Martin was pressing us and time was tight. But his time we were lucky. Whether it was desperation for the bonus or the fact that, as Gay had told us, Ree was always nice to her whereas Mam looked down on her, we’re not sure. But in any event, Gay’s resolve in this instance held, and by the following evening, we had a phone number.</p>

  <p class="indent">Our next call was to a friendly investigation agency in Malaysia. The old-boy network is fairly strong and healthy amongst respected investigation companies world-wide. Our colleagues quickly pinpointed the phone’s location: a reasonably well-known hotel in the city of Ipoh. Further, they came up with an extension number, which was more than likely the room number.</p>

  <p class="indent">Their added information, however, was not so encouraging, although they did confirm that we were probably on the right track. The hotel was well known as being a legal business that was actually owned and operated by a group whose core activities were anything but legal. What’s more, a number of pornographic movies certainly had been shot in and around the hotel. Its impressive foyer, Chinese banquet hall, and outdoor pool often featured in scenes of low-class, underground movies.</p>

  <p class="indent">Our associates further pointed out that since these Malaysian gangsters were now operating on their home turf (the hotel they owned), they would probably feel rather secure. For this reason, they most likely would not have seen any cause to monitor the Thai “starlets” too closely. More, the girls would be unlikely to have any ID, money or passports on them, so they could not go far. The hotel, they said, had security cameras and was some distance from the local airport, shops, and the central district of Ipoh.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was then time for some serious decisions all round. Martin had to decide whether or not he wanted us to continue the investigation, as, with the travel and agents involved, it was about to become an expensive operation. If he did wish to locate Ree, we had to decide how far we would go. We won’t unnecessarily endanger any of our operatives, and this now bore the hallmarks of a potentially very dangerous assignment.</p>

  <p class="indent">But Martin was hooked. He assured us Ree deserved a chance, and he was particularly upset over the way she had, he believed, been conned out of her money and forced into the position she was in. He understood we could not charge in like an anti-terrorist squad and also that contacting the authorities was going to be of little help. However, he wanted us to do all we could, to at least try and contact the girl and let her know help was nearby. And then he lathered on that wonderful salve: money was no object.</p>

  <p class="indent">In the end, we settled on a compromise. We would send our best male and female agents south to check into the hotel and try to locate Ree. Step Two would be to try to speak to her on her own, which is why we needed a female, as perhaps a “chance encounter” in a ladies toilet would offer the best opportunity. If we could get this far and verify that Ree was being detained against her will, we would then work on a plan for the agents to try and discreetly spirit her away from the hotel. Or, if Ree preferred, we could at least slip her some money to help her make her own escape.</p>

  <p class="indent">Our agreement was that, should we find her, we would explain that Martin was very worried about her and had asked us to do all we could to reunite them. We stipulated, however, that our agents would not confront any men who might be guarding Ree, and we would not allow the agents to be put in any position where they, or Ree, might be threatened.</p>

  <p class="indent">That was as far as we could go. Martin seemed happy with that. He did, of course, want to accompany the team south, but that was something we could not agree to. We devised an elaborate escape route for our agents if, by chance, they were able to get Ree into a car covertly, and we assured Martin he would be regularly updated or put in phone contact with her immediately – if that possibility eventuated.</p>

  <p class="indent">Even assuming our agents were not only able to locate the missing lovely, but also (and I realised this was a very large “BUT”) escort her safely and secretly out of Ipoh, that would not be the end of our problems. Knowing the way things work around that area, we also had to assume that there could well be those at Ipoh airport and the main Malaysian border crossing to Thailand at Padeng Bazzar who were in the pay of the syndicate. We therefore needed to remain extremely discreet throughout the entire operation. My strategy was not to fly our agents directly to Ipoh, but into Kuala Lumpur, and for them to hire a vehicle there and drive the 200 kilometres up to Ipoh. We would also have our Malaysian counterparts on standby if needed, although Martin was understandably against any additional involvement.</p>

  <p class="indent">Once in Malaysia, we needed our people to remain covert and free from suspicion for as long as possible. If they were able to locate Ree and arrange to have her moved unnoticed from the hotel, and into their rental car, my plan was for them to then drive another 200 kilometres up the coast to the small seaside town of Alor Setar. From there, they could take a ferry to the nearby island resort of Langkawi, the most northern island in Malaysian waters. From Langkawi, a ferry (of which there are four or five each day) lands you in the southern Thai town of Satun in just over an hour’s time. Being Thai, Ree would only need a Thai ID card, of which our agents had extras, to get herself on the ferry and back on Thai soil.</p>

  <p class="indent">That, then, was the simple plan. But, of course, carrying it all out would be anything but simple. Flights to Kuala Lumpur depart Bangkok on the hour, so that helped, and it is a fairly straightforward drive up Malaysia’s expansive central highway from KL to Ipoh, a city that owed its existence mainly to tin mining.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was late in the evening when our two agents arrived at the hotel and went to a rather busy coffee shop and general meeting place just inside the entrance. They discussed their chances of finding what floor the movie-makers might be on and the best way to get a room nearby. The extension number given to the hotel phone number was 903, and a look at the hotel brochure had confirmed it was indeed a nine-storey building.</p>

  <p class="indent">We had thought earlier of just calling the number, and the room, but we felt that would do little but endanger the operation and possibly put the syndicate on the alert. Being discreet was, we felt, the key to success in this investigation especially. Also, it was obvious that even if the girls were in the room, they would be unlikely to answer the phone themselves. Being a former British colony, many Malaysians speak good English. However, they also speak their own mother tongues when together, and that was yet another problem we would face.</p>

  <p class="indent">Fortified by a coffee, our agents decided to go straight to the core of the problem, or at least to try and verify it. Accordingly, they ventured over to the hotel lift, pressed the 9<sup class="calibre6">th</sup> floor button, and headed upwards. Using an old, but as is often the case, good technique, they staggered out of the lift, looking like a rather drunk and confused couple trying to find their room. This proved to be wise strategy. Just past the elevator entrance, a white chain hung across the hallway, with a “Private – no admittance” sign attached. Apparently, there were only six large suites on that floor, and the agents could make out that the doors of Rooms 903 and 904, sitting opposite, both seemed to be open, and from the sounds emanating out, a party (or was that an orgy) seemed to be in full swing. The chance of getting any closer, however, was curtailed by a menacing-looking guy who sat at a small desk just inside the chained-off area, and said simply, “Private; you go now.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Our pair could do little but get back into the lift and go down to reception. There, they asked for a top floor suite, only to be told that none were available at the moment; fancy that. It had been a long day, so they checked into a room on the floor below, updated the case controller, and left it to him to figure out the next move.</p>

  <p class="indent">We wondered if our Malaysian agency backup might be able to place staff quickly in the hotel to “cover for a sick housemaid”, but that was clutching at straws. Martin was kept in the loop, and he certainly did not want to go down that path. As he pointed out, it was not so much the additional expense, or the time it would take to get them on board, but, confirming that he had certainly done his homework on the region, we needed to keep activities around Ipoh strictly amongst ourselves to avoid any chance of the investigation being compromised.</p>

  <p class="indent">Considering that much of the criminal activity in that area was related to Chinese-Malay syndicates with known triad links, we had to agree. But we also had to come up with some novel – and quick – approach to try and confirm whether or not Ree was indeed amongst the occupants of the top floor suites.</p>

  <p class="indent">Martin was very keen to get some video or photographic evidence, but we struggled to come up with a feasible plan that would not endanger our agents or compromise the mission. Placing any sort of snake, web, or video cam anywhere on the top floor, which we now knew sported a 24-hour guard, was not going to be a simple matter. Security cameras, the agents had noted, also covered most of the hotel, both inside and out. The case controller had, of course, included what he could in their travel kit in the way of surveillance equipment, and, as a cover, we provided paperwork saying they were salespeople in this field. Even so, travelling across national borders meant they were somewhat restricted technologically.</p>

  <p class="indent">In the end, we opted to go once again with one of my old tried-and-true methods for covertly moving a substance or placing an object elsewhere. Well, one I had borrowed from Asians, if you want to be exact.</p>

  <p class="indent">First thing the next morning, we sent our agents off for shopping at the city’s largest mall. As it happened, Easter was fast approaching, so chocolate Easter eggs and bunnies were out in force. The agents brought the largest stuffed bunny they could find; that it happened to be holding a basket containing Easter eggs was going to be a bonus for the occupants of the 9<sup class="calibre6">th</sup> floor. The bugging operation was carried out by our female agent, who placed a small listening device behind the bunny’s eye, where it would not attract attention.</p>

  <p class="indent">Many bugging devices are commonly available; unfortunately, few work as well as their promoters claim. There are also, of course, many variables, in particular, the power source. Room interference is another common problem, which books or movies dealing with bugging generally ignore. Also, many people will have a TV on when in a room and awake, and this tends to distort feedback. Further, placing a device in a bag or pocket will generally result in muffled sound, and we knew in this case, the rabbit would perhaps need to be on a bed, or at least close to the occupants, to provide much audible <i class="calibre5">and</i> understandable conversation. Certainly the best results come from placing a bug in a room’s power source or light socket, but in this case, the only two hopes of that, were none and Bob!</p>

  <p class="indent">There is one other small matter here: discreetly recording other people’s conversations is an offence punishable by law, which is another reason for being particularly careful in how you plan this type of operation. In this instance, however, included in our agents’ bag of goodies was a small Israeli-made FM transmitter type device. This device was roughly the size of the bunny’s eyeball, and we knew it would work well, even through walls, for a distance of 100 to 150 meters. However, there was a drawback with this type of device: the only power source we could use was an equally small battery, and again we knew from experience that this would only last about four or five hours. Nonetheless, it was the best instrument we could come up with, considering all the circumstances. Anyway, at this point, we were only trying to confirm that Ree was actually in the room. So we set ourselves to performing a little eye surgery.</p>

  <p class="indent">Whilst the rabbit was on the operating table, our other agent ran out and picked up some wrapping paper. Shortly thereafter, the gift was ready. A card with “Room 902 “ written on it was then duly placed on top of the basket of eggs. They squeezed Bugs Bunny, as he had now been fittingly dubbed, into a large plastic bag and drove to the airport, our girl behind the wheel. She dropped her partner off, along with Bugs, and he quickly strode into the building, then back out to the waiting taxi rank. Picking out an older driver, who he hoped had no young children who would love a large white bunny holding a basket of Easter eggs, he asked how much the fare to the hotel was, then handed over double, saying he was running late, but could the driver deliver the bunny in the bag to the hotel reception area and tell them it was for room 902.</p>

  <p class="indent">He watched the taxi drive off, trusting the driver would carry out his instructions, and then went back to find his fellow agent, relatively happy that their cover remained safe. As to getting some audio from Room 902, well, that would be in the lap of the gods – or, in this case, in the eye of the bunny.</p>

  <p class="indent">Asian women of all ages tend to have a childlike affinity for stuffed animals, so that, coupled with the fact that Easter was approaching and the hope that some of the guys in the suite might have had an interest in the girls staying content, we felt we had a 50-50 chance of Bugs being allowed into the inner sanctum of the hotel’s top floor.</p>

  <p class="indent">Of course, what was also required, should our Trojan bunny be accepted, was that it be placed in an area where our agents, back in their room below, could get some idea of just what was happening in the suites above before the battery ran down.</p>

  <p class="indent">Returning to the hotel, they cast a casual look around the reception area. With no sign of any Easter bunny, they hoped their efforts had reaped a positive result.</p>

  <p class="indent">Back in their room, the agents tuned in and waited. The sounds of a door shutting and a toilet flushing were the first signs that the plan may just be working. After that, however, silence reigned. Had Bugs been put in a cupboard, or had the battery already run down? It was approaching mid-day when some mumblings were first detected, and shortly thereafter, a clear word that had the agents do a quiet high-five. <i class="calibre5">Grad-dai,</i> the Thai word for rabbit, had been clearly heard, which triggered our agents’ elation.</p>

  <p class="indent">One problem for the agents now was that they did not know the actual sound of Ree’s voice, so without a visual sighting, we would have to play a copy of the muffled audio feedback to Martin, which we had arranged to do as soon as possible to try and get conformation. However, now our agents were sure that at least two Thai girls were indeed in the suites above.</p>

  <p class="indent">Snippets of conversation filtered through, mostly female and in Thai, and the one thing that did become apparent was that the occupants were about to go downstairs to eat. This could well be the breakthrough we needed. Our male agent sauntered out into the hallway, looking as though he was waiting for someone, but he was actually keeping an eye on the lifts to see if any went to Level 9, while the female agent continued to monitor the transmitter feedback. Fading voices, followed by a door shutting, signified to her that the subjects were leaving the suite, and a moment later, the outside agent reported the lift heading up past the 8<sup class="calibre6">th</sup> floor that they were on.</p>

  <p class="indent">The main hotel restaurant was on the first floor, while the coffee shop and 24-hour snack bar were on the ground floor. There was also the possibility that the party would be going outside to eat. Our agent in the hallway pressed the down button, while the other waited in the room, door ajar, ready to provide back-up. When the lift stopped at the 8<sup class="calibre6">th</sup> floor, our agent stepped in and joined the lady whom he knew from Martin’s photographs to be the elusive Ree. Another slim Thai girl was with her. Both had casual clothes and dark glasses on, and looked like they had had a very hard night!</p>

  <p class="indent">Accompanying the girls was the surly minder whom the agents had encountered on their earlier visit to the 9<sup class="calibre6">th</sup> floor. Noting they had pressed the button for the 1<sup class="calibre6">st</sup> Floor, our man pressed Ground, then quickly punched a numeral 1 into his mobile phone and sent a text message off to his sister agent.</p>

  <p class="indent">Level 1 housed what was called the Chinese banquet hall, and when our female agent arrived there a few minutes later, <i class="calibre5">Yum Cha,</i> the popular Chinese lunch spread was in full swing. She asked for a table for two, and was shown to a place some distance from the group she assumed was their quarry; but they were, nonetheless, within sight. A text to her fellow agent soon had him joining her, and they partook in an impressive array of the usual <i class="calibre5">Yum Cha</i> fare of chicken’s feet, various dumplings, sticky rice, Peking duck and custard tarts while waiting to see if Miss Ree, whom they were reasonably sure they had now located, might at some point adjourn to the ladies’ room.</p>

  <p class="indent">The table the Thai girls were at now included another five or six people, and judging from the personal waiter service, there was certainly affluence, or at least influence, among the more senior men seated there. Enough glittering bracelets, necklaces and medallions were on show to start a small gold shop, while it was obvious that the array of sunglasses had not been picked up cheaply at a local market. Those shades were evidently needed to cover badly bloodshot eyes.</p>

  <p class="indent">The body language of the girls did not indicate any sign of worry or being detained, but until we could actually speak to her privately, we would have no idea of Ree’s current level of freedom, her itinerary, or, indeed, her state of mind.</p>

  <p class="indent">Finally, the other girl we assumed was also Thai (as well as a relative of Ms Mam) made a move towards the restroom, and our agents saw that Ree was about to follow. Our female agent moved quickly, and was able to get between the pair, while the other agent continued to watch the table to see if any minders went after the girls. He was relieved to see that conversation and eating seemed to be continuing as before. As the first girl entered the bathroom, our lady agent was able to intercept Ree right at the entrance, telling her in Thai that she needed to speak to her quickly and urgently.</p>

  <p class="indent">Ree seemed happy enough to hear her out, so she quickly got to the point of the conversation. Was she okay? Was she being held against her will? Did she need help in getting out of Malaysia? Although showing signs of drug use, hangover, and other associated repercussions of an orgy, Ree confirmed that was her name and asked how our agent knew it.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Oh, I know Mam,” was our agent’s quick reply, which was accepted with a nod.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Did she send you?” Ree then asked.</p>

  <p class="indent">“No. Actually, Martin has been a little worried about you,” our agent replied.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Who is Martin? “ was the rather surprising answer our agent got to that admission.</p>

  <p class="indent">Somewhat knocked off stride by that remark, our agent was contemplating what else to say when Ree’s friend poked her head out the door to see where she was. Fortunately, Ree told her all was fine, that she would be there in a minute, then repeated her question. After being told Martin, the American you met last month in Bangkok, the penny dropped, and Ree explained that yes, she did intend to meet him, but suddenly another movie offer had come up and she had to put her career first. This time it was our agent’s turn to be somewhat confused: “Career??”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Oh, yes,” Ree enthused, “This is the second movie I make here, and the next one going to be made at Phuket with a German director. He said he’s going to make me famous.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Ree told the agent to say “Hi” to her friend Martin, and to tell him she would try and catch up when she was back in Bangkok next week. She then turned and went to join her friend and co-star in the ladies’ room.</p>

  <p class="indent">A somewhat dazed agent made her way back to her partner, and when he asked how it all had gone, she told him he’d better forget that last custard tart, as they should get out of there as soon as possible – just in case Ree mentioned something to her friends, financial supporters, or fans, whatever bracket you might put them in. Moreover, the agents would certainly be travelling on their own as it was now clear that Ree was certainly not under any restraint. In fact, she was rather enjoying her somewhat dubious association with fame and the pornographic film world.</p>

  <p class="indent">As any interference with their star, or interruption to their schedule, would no doubt not be well received by the syndicate, it was certainly time to depart Ipoh ASAP. As our agents are always prepared for a quick departure, the woman went down to reception to check out while the man quickly returned to the room to pick up their packed bags, gather the audio equipment, and do a final check that nothing was left behind. He carefully checked that there were no phone number impressions on notepads or such. As to Bugs … well, he would just have to take his own chances!</p>

  <p class="indent">It was less than ten minutes later that they were in their rental car, heading back down the freeway to KL with the realization that the case had came to a rather abrupt and unplanned end. They wondered just how Martin would react to the news, hoping it wouldn’t be a case of “shooting the messenger”.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was certain that Martin was not going to be happy with the news. However, as Control remarked at a later debriefing, “At least he will be able to see her in the flesh anytime he likes.”</p>
