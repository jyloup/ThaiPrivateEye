  <p class="center">“Our admiration of the antique is not admiration of the old, but of the natural”</p>

  <p class="noindent">The majority of tourists who arrive in Bangkok and want some nearby sea and sand take the hour or two drive east to Pattaya. Thai locals in need of the same environment usually head a similar distance south, to Hua Hin or Cha Am. I have learnt to never underestimate the value of local knowledge, and in this respect came to make Cha Am my favourite convenient getaway from the smog of Bangkok. I often took my family down to Cha Am for a few days, where food and accommodation were about half the cost of the same in Pattaya, and the water twice as clean!</p>

  <p class="indent">You also tend to meet a somewhat better standard of beach-walker. Not that I’m knocking the more dubious beachside inhabitants of Pattaya, or the place itself. Far from it; in fact, we get a lot of business from that resort. However, it was always nice to travel south, especially if you could manage it mid-week. Weekends saw a huge influx as many affluent Thais from Bangkok headed down to their holiday apartments at the two seaside resorts. Even the Thai royal family has for many years maintained a holiday home in Hua Hin.</p>

  <p class="indent">Also there in Hua Hin was Rob, an Aussie who apparently was living something like a king himself. He had, it seemed, been able to organize what I’m sure many men would consider the ideal lifestyle. Formerly a struggling small stallholder at Melbourne’s famed Queen Victoria Market, a trip to Thailand some years previously had alerted him to some of the Kingdom’s many elegant objects, and we are not talking demimondaines here !</p>

  <p class="indent">Rob had upgraded his business to higher quality Asian artefacts and business had boomed. He now had three Melbourne outlets, and was about to open another in Sydney. His usual itinerary was two weeks in Melbourne organizing his shops, staff, and stock, followed by two weeks travelling around Thailand, stocking up on exquisite handicrafts, and apparently accompanied by an equally exquisite secretary named Ying, who doubled as his girlfriend.</p>

  <p class="indent">Rob had obviously done his homework and had things well worked out. We weren’t sure we would buy a used car off him, but we had to admire the way he had structured his lifestyle.</p>

  <p class="indent">The lovely Ying had a good background, was a graduate of Chiang Mai University, and had the classic high cheekbone and pale skin of the girls from that area. In many cases, this came , along with family wealth, from a distant relationship to affluent Chinese who in generations past had decided to forsake various people’s revolutions and flee south with their assets. Family wealth was also frequently associated with such a pedigree.</p>

  <p class="indent">Chiang Mai is seen as perhaps the art and cultural centre of Thailand, so having a local to negotiate on his behalf at the many factories on the city’s outskirts that produced high-class jewellery, Buddhist amulets, teak furniture and related treasures was a wise move, quite apart from the fact that Ying was a perfect model for showing off his latest purchases in the company brochures.</p>

  <p class="indent">From Chiang Mai, the couple would head Rob’s trendy Jeep across country to the eastern province of Surin and a small village known as Ban Khwao Sinarin, where the locals had for hundreds of years carried on a Cambodian art of crafting fine silverware. More merchandise would be brought from Bangkok’s Chatujak market, and they would then return to what was basically their home, a condo Rob had brought in Hua Hin. Two weeks would be spent itemizing stock, finalizing shipping and relaxing, and so the cycle continued. So what then was his problem?</p>

  <p class="indent">With the setting up of his new Sydney outlet, Rob was going to be back in the land of koalas and kangaroos for perhaps a month this time. Considering that Ying was a very attractive and bright 25-year-old with her own car and money in the bank who also, according to Rob, was not at all averse to sex, drugs and rock&amp;roll, he did have some anxieties – not so much about Ying’s loyalty, you understand, but about how young local men might well try and distract her.</p>

  <p class="indent">He told us it had been made clear to Ying that any association with past boyfriends, of which there had no doubt been a few, or any hint of new ones, would instantly spell the end of their association and the obviously easy-going and well-paid lifestyle to which she had quickly become accustomed. Knowing (so he thought) all the answers, Rob had also installed a landline to the condo so that he could call at anytime and confirm that she was, indeed, at their home. Nonetheless, he decided that during his upcoming extended sojourn, it would be a good time to have Ying’s activities monitored, especially as he was considering making their arrangement somewhat more permanent.</p>

  <p class="indent">He had been unsure as to her daily routine when he was away, apart from confirming that like the majority of Thai girls who didn’t have a day job, she was unlikely to be seen much before mid-day! Accordingly, our team’s first step was to set up covert surveillance from a vehicle parked outside the condo. Hua Hin being relatively quiet, especially during the week, it was easy to get a parking spot almost directly opposite, and the team let the video cameras run for twelve hours from 10 am until 10 pm. Admittedly, after sunset, the quality of the video was not that great, but still good enough to see who came and went. The recording was retrieved every four hours, and the vehicles rotated at the same time. The recording was then taken to our nearby base, where the rather time-consuming task of editing would begin. Sightings of Ying were then burned onto a separate DVD that we would forward to Rob in due course.</p>

  <p class="indent">A rather boring assignment, but boring is, surprisingly, the norm for our type of work. Coverage was to last for seven days, during which time we saw the subject come and go and managed to get a good idea of her daily routine. However, as far as we were aware, she had always been on her own. The only question mark: under the current agreement, surveillance ceased at 10 pm, and on a few occasions she had not returned by then. One other significant point was that we had not yet been inside the condo, although it did appear all was fine there as well.</p>

  <p class="indent">Rob was kept informed; one could almost note a touch of smugness as we confirmed Ying’s apparent solitary existence. We then suggested, as a final check, that we rent an apartment inside the same building for a few days. As it was midweek, it was most likely there would be vacant apartments, usually rented out by owners who used the accommodations only occasionally, on weekends or holidays. Enquiries confirmed this to be so, and thus, with Rob’s go-ahead, an apartment (which, the receptionist sadly informed us, lacked a sea-view) was rented for three days. Ideally for our agents, its balcony overlooked the street and condo entrance, and even better, we were able to get one on the same floor as his apartment, the current abode of an apparently lonely Miss Ying.</p>

  <p class="indent">The old and normally reliable method of detection was the first step undertaken by our now on-site agents: the simple shoe inspection. Amazing how many two-timing Thais have been caught out simply by their adherence to established rules of good behaviour. Thai etiquette decrees that one always leaves one’s shoes outside a house, apartment or temple. Outside Rob’s apartment were just two pairs of women’s footwear, which inspection of the daily videos confirmed had both graced Ying’s dainty feet. Likewise, a check of the portable clothesline on the balcony showed no sign of anything other than female attire. It was then onto the more modern surveillance techniques in which Thai Private Eye is amongst the region’s leaders these days (fortunately for Rob).</p>

  <p class="indent">An optical-fibre Flexi-Snake cam that just slides under the door was set up, confirming the big advantage of being able to rent an apartment on the same floor. These devices do have their limitations, but are quite effective in well-lit hallways with plenty of natural light during the day. In Thailand, most apartment hallways are well lit at night for security purposes, so that also helped our operation. Not to cast any aspersions on the Thai construction industry, but the majority of Thai apartments also seem to have a noticeable gap between door and floor, although our esteemed company director believes it’s just to let cockroaches come and go as they please. Nonetheless, it also proves very convenient for employing this type of camera.<br class="calibre4"/>
  <br class="calibre4"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">The case control agent was doing the first spell in the apartment, as this required discreetly setting up the snake cam, which was placed in a sock in a specially adapted open-toed sandal outside the door. Fortunately, it was very quiet in the early afternoon, and with no one about, our man could easily check that all the angles were correct, the cables secured and fed back to the room’s TV. He had barely closed the door, hooked up the DVR, got himself a cold drink and settled down to watch the main afternoon feature, “Thai Hallway”, when a young man appeared on the TV screen, apparently coming out of Ying’s door! Our agent had to double-check the doorway: had the man indeed exited from the targeted apartment? The confirmation he needed came a moment later when Miss Ying herself exited the very same door. A frantic call to the agents outside, who in typical Thai fashion had wandered off to find some food, soon had them back in action.</p>

  <p class="indent">The man had disappeared, but Ying had only just stepped out onto the street, so they followed her down the road to the town’s main supermarket. Being caught a little off guard, they did not have the usual covert, body-worn video cams fitted, but the high-end mobile telephone camera/videos they are issued provided a very good back-up. They managed to get stills from different angles of Ying and her friend walking around shopping, like a regular married couple, and ultimately both placing articles in the same shopping trolley.</p>

  <p class="indent">Amazingly, once inside the store, the pair dropped their guard. Outside, however, they kept up the pretence of not knowing each other. Well, they tried to, but once we knew of the connection, it then became obvious that they were together. Thais don’t normally show affection in public anyway, but from their nods and glances, walking apart but waiting for each other at crossings, there was no doubt they knew each other, and each other’s habits, very well.</p>

  <p class="indent">Meanwhile, Control was running a quick scan of the previous week’s footage. Sure enough, there he was, the same guy walking just five or ten metres in front of her almost every time. Continued surveillance, and a thorough study of the tapes, would no doubt have brought the man to our attention eventually. However, once it was known who to concentrate on, it became so bloody obvious. Life certainly has become tougher for secret Thai boyfriends over the past few years!</p>

  <p class="indent">An agent notified Control that the shopping trip was almost over and they were both at the checkout counter. He then made sure that the snake cam was fine-tuned and the footage being recorded. He also set up a Sony video camera on a tripod on the balcony to film their return. The Thai boyfriend appeared around the corner shortly thereafter, and Ying followed a little later. The beau entered the building first and headed upstairs to where the two apartments were. Sitting in his apartment, viewing the suddenly far more entertaining version of “Thai Hallway”, Control saw our new target peep his head around the corner from the top of the stairwell and wait at the top of the stairs. A few moments later, he turned round and gave Ying the all-clear as she also made her way up the stairs. The crafty boyfriend opened the door and, without taking his shoes off, scraped them several times on the doormat and slipped in. Ying, being the clean, polite Thai girl that she was, took her shoes off and left them outside.</p>

  <p class="indent">Rob was duly called and notified of the new findings. We asked him if he knew why the pair had been so cautious. He told us rather sadly that he had, in fact, repeated his warning just before he left that he would know if she was two-timing him and what the consequences would be. Of course, all that this warning had accomplished was to make the case more difficult and cost him more money. Or maybe, as we tend to suspect on many occasions, with so many of our clients, Rob did not want to know the truth. Perhaps subconsciously, he gave her that warning so she could cover her tracks. Then, in his own mind, her being cautious was tantamount to her being innocent. Yes, human nature can be weird.</p>

  <p class="indent">This thought was all but confirmed a week later when we gave Rob a final call to verify that he had received the DVD and all the relevant information that had been sent. He told us he had already confronted Ying about her companion, and she had told him it was just her brother’s friend staying there until he could find a place of his own. And in any case, the fellow was gay! Amazingly, Rob told us that he believed her! Well, why not: perhaps there is an unwritten Thai law that gay friends of brothers don’t have to leave their shoes at the door and are not permitted to leave an apartment the same time as a female?</p>

  <p class="indent">Thinking of Rob, his trade, and the association with Chiang Mai brings back memories of a case I conducted myself a number of years ago. Allow me to backtrack a little, for this is a good tale that begs to be told.</p>

  <p class="indent">Over the years, both myself and the current team have uncovered boiler rooms in Bangkok; had almost daily reports of Nigerian 419 scams; been asked to try and retrieve money from numerous versions of the fake-money-in-a-suitcase scam, jewellery scams, the new-suit scam, and just straight-out, basic rip-offs. I thought I had seen them all, but what I have to relate here was, in my opinion, one of the more ingenious.</p>

  <p class="indent">I had been contacted by a well-known British insurance company that was trying to confirm the value of a supposedly rare, expensive carved teak tiger that they believed came from the Southeast Asian region. A client of the company had purchased the item from an equally well-known UK auction house for a very substantial sum and wished to insure it accordingly.</p>

  <p class="indent">As is standard operating procedure, the insurance company had their own assessors and investigators check on the background details, and they had noted some discrepancies in the information the original seller of the antique carving had given the auction house at the time of sale to their client. Briefly, the story given by the seller was that he had inherited the item from an old uncle who had apparently spent a lifetime serving in the British army. Included in old uncle’s career had been a stint in India during the 1930s, upholding law, order and the British way amongst the colonials. During this time, uncle had attained the rank of Major. (Shades of “It Ain’t Half Hot”, the British comedy series set in that era, sprang to mind.) According to the seller, his uncle had been given the item by a local maharajah as a token of goodwill. For all these tangled reasons, the seller himself was unable to provide a specific date or place of origin for the prized and intricately carved life-sized teak tiger.</p>

  <p class="indent">The insurance company was aware that the general rule of thumb regarding any such gifts to officers of Her Majesty’s (or, as in that period, His Majesty’s) armed forces was that they became gifts to the crown or the state. The insurance people then did a search of their substantial databases and found no trace of any army officer, with major’s rank or otherwise, within the seller’s immediate family.</p>

  <p class="indent">This discrepancy had then prompted their investigators to dig a little deeper. I wasn’t privy to the company’s methods or contacts but simply informed that it “had come to their attention” that not too long before the article was sent to the auction house, the seller had made a reasonable payment to a Chiang Mai-based export company. The insurers asked me to follow up on that particular lead. I rang the Chiang Mai company, said I was buying some teak furniture in the area, and would they be able to arrange shipping to the UK for me. I was assured this was no problem, and that they were very used to handling that type of operation. I mentioned I might buy some additional items as well, and that I was interested in larger teak carvings; could they recommend any companies that specialized in that field. I also added the magic words, “money no problem”.</p>

  <p class="indent">I was given the name of an obviously Thai-Chinese company, based on the outskirts of Chiang Mai, which, I was informed, was renowned for its workmanship and expertise with teak. The insurance company people were not paying any massive retainer, but they were keen to have some further investigation done. As it was early days in the Thai Private Eye business, and clients were not beating down my door at the time, I found myself on the overnight “rattler” to Chiang Mai the following evening. It was 14 bone-shaking hours later, and close to mid-day, when I wandered down the platform of the Chiang Mai station, to be met by a horde of taxi and tuk-tuk drivers, all ready, willing and able to take me to the esteemed company’s premises. (Tuk-tuks are three-wheeled, motorcycle-like vehicles that are a popular form of transportation throughout the Kingdom.)</p>

  <p class="indent">Quotes of 800 baht, then 500 baht soon worked their down to a realistic 150 baht after I had called a few of them thieving lizards in Thai. While Thai is spoken throughout the whole country, most regions also have a local dialect that tends to be used amongst the lower classes, and although I had a decent knowledge of I-san or Lao, as used in the Northeast, and Khamen, as often spoken in those provinces bordering Cambodia, my knowledge of Lanna, the Northern dialect, was pretty much limited to “hello”, “good bye” and “how much”!</p>

  <p class="indent">Most taxi or the tuk-tuk drivers are, in any case, usually happy to take tourists to manufacturing outlets (or yes, massage parlours) on the cheap as they normally get a 10 % payback on any money customers they deliver spend at that particular establishment. A 15-minute ride later, I was walking into the company office and being greeted by a plump, bespectacled, but very pleasant Thai-Chinese woman who spoke near perfect English. As most Thais would tell you, her English abilities, combined with her healthy size, signified she probably came from an affluent family.</p>

  <p class="indent">This was confirmed a few moments later, after I explained I was an agent buying artefacts for a wealthy client. I, of course, once again mentioned those magic words – “money no problem” – and was duly granted the privilege of having the factory manager come out to give me a personal tour. Obviously a brother of the receptionist, he would have to rely on the heavy gold chain and amulet around his neck rather than his natural good looks to woo one of the region’s beauties. As this was a family-run concern, I wouldn’t have been at all surprised if mum and dad were not out in the backroom, tools in hand, working on teak!</p>

  <p class="indent">I was soon to get the chance to find out – or at least to see the actual workroom. I was shown some exquisite pieces in the main showroom, highly lacquered teak tables inlaid with intricate designs, mainly picturing early Thai or Chinese scenes. I knew these were both very expensive and a type of status symbol amongst the Kingdom’s wealthier subjects. I passed on my admiration of the work, and mentioned that, as my client was a Westerner, he was more interested in carved teak animals. No problem; I was taken to another part of the showroom, where an array of beautifully crafted birds, monkeys, elephants and, in fact, practically all of the Chinese zodiac signs were on display.</p>

  <p class="indent">One of the first things I had committed to memory when I became domiciled in Asia was the Chinese zodiac signs. This was for very practical reasons: if you ask the age of an Asian girl, especially one who hangs out in somewhat dubious surroundings, I figure you have a rather slim hope of getting a true answer. Ask her what sign she was born under, however, and invariably you will get the truth. Know your relevant Chinese zodiac dates then, and it becomes “elementary, my dear Watson” as to confirming someone’s age – well, at least within a 12-year cycle!</p>

  <p class="indent">Picking up a shiny black teak horse, a sign I had some affinity with (coincidentally, the horse later became the sign my daughter was born under), I told my very obliging guide that my client was born in 1950, and I wondered what sign that was. “Ah, that is tiger,” he said, confirming what I already knew. This neatly led to my next question: “Have you ever made life-sized tigers?”</p>

  <p class="indent">I was again told “no ploblem”, and, in fact, that type of request was relatively common, but as they were made to order, he did not have any on hand to show me. The only life-sized larger animals currently in the store were the elephants at the showroom entrance.</p>

  <p class="indent">I informed my new friend that my client would be very keen to order a life-sized tiger, and yes, a substantial deposit was, likewise, no problem. This was becoming very much a “no-problem” investigation. However, the big query was yet to come. I told him the only thing working against his company’s obviously high quality, top-class works of art was the fact that my client was a great collector of antiques, and his first preference, if possible, would be to purchase a life-sized teak tiger that had perhaps been made many years ago. Guess what: I drew a knowing smile, followed by yet another “no ploblem”</p>

  <p class="indent">I was duly escorted to the rear of the showroom, a door was unlocked, and I was ushered into what was, in fact, a huge workshop. The workers here were mostly women. (Whether or not the manager’s mother was amongst them, I’m not sure.) All had their heads down and were hard at work on various stages of a vast array of products.</p>

  <p class="indent">There was a strong odour present, intensified by a lack of air vents, which wouldn’t have pleased Western health authorities. I assumed it came from the lacquer coating being applied. I was soon to find out that this assumption was incorrect.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mr Manager led me towards the rear of the large building and opened what seemed to be a small drying cabinet. He carefully lifted out an object and handed me the most intricate, delicate piece of woodwork I had ever seen: a very finely carved sea horse. I took it gingerly, afraid of damaging such an aged and fragile piece. “Beautiful,” I told him. “How old is it?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“What you think?” he asked me.</p>

  <p class="indent">Having absolutely no idea, I guessed, “Fifty years at least.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Again, I got that knowing smile. I gently handed the carving back, he returned it to the cabinet, and beckoned me towards a large vat at the very rear of the workshop. “Sea horse we make last week,” he told me, as I gazed at a number of pieces of teak floating in an open, very toxic-smelling vat of acid! “Soak in here a few days, make look very old”</p>

  <p class="indent"><i class="calibre5">“Khon Jeen chalart mark”</i> was all I could say, letting him know in Thai that Chinese people were indeed very clever. (Although born and bred Thais, those with a Chinese heritage still adhere closely to their Chinese roots and are happy to be referred to as <i class="calibre5">“Khon Jeen”,</i> or Chinese person.)</p>

  <p class="indent">This compliment was again met with a nod and a smile. The tour was over, and my guide keen to leave the workroom, the acid fumes making his bespectacled eyes blink profusely.</p>

  <p class="indent">“You can treat a life-sized tiger this way?” I asked.</p>

  <p class="indent">“No ploblem, we make tiger many time, even make real-size elephant this style,” he boasted.</p>

  <p class="indent">“That will be perfect for my client then,” I told him. “I will confirm the order first thing tomorrow.”</p>

  <p class="indent">As he turned to lead the way out, I slipped a small camera out of my pocket and, aware of the numerous camera signs around with a large red cross over them, quickly snapped off some shots while following him back to the refreshing, air-cooled showroom.</p>

  <p class="indent">They were not the greatest of prints, but along with my report, they certainly gave a much more accurate indication of the formerly unknown origin and year of manufacture of the teak tiger that had recently been sold at auction over in the UK for a very substantial sum.</p>

  <p class="indent">The insurance company expressed their thanks, and told me they wouldbe certain to contact us regarding any future Asian investigations. Just what the result of my investigation was, I never did find out, although no doubt the request for a very substantial insurance cover was dismissed.</p>

  <p class="indent">I do sympathize with the person buying what he or she believed was a genuine antique. Nevertheless, I had to admit it was indeed a well-worked scam, and it further bolstered the solid attitude I have developed over the years: with regard to investigations in Asia, and the subsequent results of these investigations, nothing, but NOTHING, surprises me!</p>
