  <p class="noindent">I mentioned that things don’t always go to plan in the world of investigations, and also that vindictiveness is something that perhaps is more often on some clients’ minds than they let on.</p>

  <p class="indent">With regard to things going awry, one very vivid episode still stands out in my memory.</p>

  <p class="indent">I had been investigating a traditional Thai massage worker. As it happened, she hailed from Buriram province in the northeast, and consequently, in addition to Thai, she also spoke Khamen, a Cambodian dialect. From my earlier times managing a hotel in neighbouring Surin, I was one of the few Westerners who had some knowledge of that language.</p>

  <p class="indent">I had initially struggled to get much information out of the lady concerned and had learnt she was a very well-trained and thorough masseuse, and in two visits as a client, I had found she was 100% straight in the art of performing traditional Thai massage only. I also had walked out with muscles aching in places I didn’t even know I had muscles!</p>

  <p class="indent">To get a little closer to her, to try and unlock any secrets she may have had about her love life, and, in particular, to find out how enamoured she was of my client, I had reverted to speaking with her in Khamen. The Thai class system being what it is, Bangkokians tend to look down on those from upcountry who also speak Lao, as many people from the Northeast or I-sarn region do, and to speak Khamen seems to put one even lower down the Thai social ladder.</p>

  <p class="indent">I had soon learnt, however, that being able to speak that dialect brought me much closer to the people of Surin, Buriram and Si-saket, many of whom had Cambodian heritage, and, quite coincidentally, were to be found working in the local night trade.</p>

  <p class="indent">This girl, apart from possessing that somewhat unique Thai-Cambodian brand of beauty, was likewise much more friendly and forthcoming when she found I knew her native language. I was then able to find that, contrary to my client’s beliefs, she was not deeply in love with him, but simply saw him as a friend or father figure.</p>

  <p class="indent">The client was not really happy, or, I suspect, didn’t totally believe me when I reported this back to him. Valentine’s Day was approaching, and although he could not be there on the day itself, he had planned a surprise visit a day or two later. He then asked me to purchase a gold bracelet and have it secretly delivered to the lady on February 14<sup class="calibre6">th</sup>. It was obviously a rather busy day for a private eye, and although I could have asked one of my assistants to drop it off, there were many girls working at that particular massage centre, so I wanted to make sure it was delivered to the right one.</p>

  <p class="indent">I guess my mistake was in not using one of my regular motorcycle taxi boys, but it was hot, and I was en route to another job, so I had just hailed an air-con taxi from outside the gold shop. I explained to the driver that we needed to stop briefly outside the massage centre, and that I would give him a 200 baht bonus for quickly going in and delivering the package to Miss Metta from Buriram. All seemed to be fine: I sat back in the taxi watching to see that the driver didn’t palm the bracelet or pull some such trick. I saw him approaching at the counter, then handing the package over as planned to the right girl. In less than a minute, he came back out, full of smiles, got into the cab, but ignored my cries of <i class="calibre5">“Bai, bai”</i> (the Thai word for “go”).</p>

  <p class="indent">You can probably guess what happened next. Miss Metta, looking resplendent in special Valentine’s Day attire, came rushing out, desperate to thank her new-found beau. I’m sure if I had asked the driver to head straight to the nearest short-time hotel, it would have been no problem and a very exciting time would have been had by both of us. Of course, that would not have impressed my client, so I had to turn down her advances, and admit that my visits, and the gift, had been on behalf of someone rather more keen to marry her than I was.</p>

  <p class="indent">She, of course, was not overjoyed that perhaps I didn’t really like her – or, more to the point, that I had been somewhat devious, and certainly was not at all impressed that her prospective beau would stoop to such activity. When the client called in a few days later to find out how things had gone, he himself was not at all complimentary, and thought that I had about as much skill as an investigator as Inspector Clouseau on psychotropic drugs!</p>

  <p class="indent">A more recent case that went awry happened when we were contacted by Sybil, an elderly, well-spoken British lady who asked us to conduct surveillance on her 65-year-old husband.</p>

  <p class="indent">Having been married almost 40 years, she thought she knew his habits rather well. However, he had lately taken to gallivanting around the globe with a particularly well-endowed Russian lady. The wife had gained access to his email, so she had been keeping track of his exploits as he updated friends on his escapades. Sybil assured us (though such assurances do not mean a lot to a cynical PI) that she was not at all interested in his sexual conquests, but simply wanted to put a stop to the spending spree that was fast diminishing their grandchildren’s education fund.</p>

  <p class="indent">That the “Ageing Lothario” (as we named him) would bother to bring the busty Muscovite to Bangkok seemed to us a little like taking coal to Newcastle, but Sybil was the client, she was the one paying, and she assured us she had all the information regarding his schedule.</p>

  <p class="indent">Shortly afterwards, along with a retainer, we received details of his flight from Tokyo to Bangkok, their hotel booking, pictures of them both, and a description of his luggage. A rather straightforward case, it seemed, of following them to their pre-booked hotel and taking a few pictures along the way. What could be easier?</p>

  <p class="indent">As is our usual mode of operation, a three-man team was assigned. One was stationed at the Arrivals hall, another in a car nearby, and the third booked into his hotel, positioned in the lobby, reading. Flight AA5832 from Tokyo landed on time around 9 pm, but an hour later it seemed all passengers had disembarked, with no sign of anyone resembling our quarry.</p>

  <p class="indent">Had our agent missed him? Had he been waylaid by Immigration? Had a heart attack? Control told the agents to stay put and to check out the later flight from Tokyo, due in around midnight. This proved to be rather astute advice, as the British gentleman was, indeed, spotted coming through Arrivals with the exodus from that later flight.</p>

  <p class="indent">There was, however, no sign of any Russian female companion, well-built or otherwise. Also notable was the apparent lack of baggage for a world traveller; our target had just one small piece of hand luggage. Had his luggage been forwarded directly to the hotel? Perhaps there had been a mix-up and it was on the earlier flight. Or maybe someone else, such as the mysterious Russian lady, had his luggage.</p>

  <p class="indent">All a little strange really for a “straightforward” case. However, for the moment it was a matter of just passing on the details of the taxi he hailed to Agent #2, who dutifully followed him to his city hotel. At that stage, the case was handed over to Agent #3, who had been waiting patiently in the hotel lounge. He confirmed that Sybil’s wayward husband had checked in and retired to his room. Agent #1 had remained at the airport, just to see if Miss Moscow did in fact appear, and was rewarded some 20 minutes later with seeing an indeed well-endowed blonde. Said blonde was doing a good imitation of a has-been movie star, pushing a trolley laden down with designer blue luggage along with Mr Lothario’s distinctive brown suitcase.</p>

  <p class="indent">By this time, of course, our own vehicle was back in the city, so our agent hailed an airport taxi and tried to follow the buxom blonde. This only got him about as far as the first freeway tollbooth, where he lost her in a maze of taxis. No problem: our agent at the hotel was alerted to await her pending arrival. And so he waited. And waited. By 3 am, it was obvious that she was a no-show, and thoughts that this wasn’t quite going according to script really started to multiply.</p>

  <p class="indent">The agent at the hotel was told to get a few hours sleep, but to be down in the dining hall when it opened for breakfast at 7 am. Then, once Lothario appeared, some back-up would be sent to help track his movements for the day.</p>

  <p class="indent">First thing our agent did when he went downstairs in the morning was the standard scrutinizing of room keys behind the front desk. Our quarry’s room key was in plain view!</p>

  <p class="indent">Checking with hotel staff confirmed that we had the right room number, but a number of calls to the room yielded no answer. Perhaps he had gone for an early morning walk, so we remained at the hotel until midday, as the expense account tally for cups of coffee mounted rapidly!</p>

  <p class="indent">Finally, we realized we had been given the slip, so Control had the disappointing task of contacting Sybil with the news.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Oh,” said Sybil, “I thought he may be on his guard, as I did have a local firm follow him to the same hotel about six months ago, so I immediately got on a plane, flew to Bangkok, and confronted him in the room.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Suffice it to say we were not all that pleased or impressed. Often, in fact, the cause of cases going awry is because they are compromised by the client. Like Sybil, they neglect to give you the full background, or else at some stage in the job, they can’t help but let the subject know some snippet of covert information that has been gathered. Of course, there is also then the danger of having our operatives being confronted by very irate husbands, girlfriends, or – worse – girlfriends’ husbands! Revenge and vindictiveness are traits that do surface often amongst a number of our clients and targets.</p>

  <p class="indent">For instance, we recently handled a straightforward case for an Australian woman. Yes, her husband was having an affair with a local bargirl. Love had been pledged, marriage plans formed, and, of course, monies promised. Unbeknown to him, however, he was not the only sponsor of this particular lovely, but that is nothing unusual.</p>

  <p class="indent">The average wage in Thailand probably falls into the US$200-300 per month range. When a working girl is used to earning five or even ten times that average monthly wage by way of bar fines, tips, payment for extracurricular activities, not to mention monthly retainers from various sponsors, she won’t always settle for a basic monthly payment whilst she awaits a visa or attends school. After experiencing the bright city lights and easy money, going back home and planting rice just does not have the same allure. Moreover, her family by then has most likely become accustomed to monthly cash handouts and they don’t want those flows to cease either. However, I digress.</p>

  <p class="indent">Not completely happy just with the evidence, or the fact that her husband was himself being two-timed, the women wanted us to “beat the girl up a bit”. When we advised her that that was not something we could be part of, she then wanted us to “cut her hair off” so she couldn’t work in the bar scene for a while. That was the end of our discussion. We didn’t even bother to inform her that some very fine wigs are made in Thailand.</p>

  <p class="indent">This was not the only time we were asked to perform some activity that went far beyond what we were willing to do. Another such case involved a sixty-year-old Canadian man who contacted us. We immediately sympathized with this gentleman’s plight: his legal and, yes, somewhat younger Thai wife had emptied their Thai bank account and also sold, or at least transferred, the new home he had built to her parents. This could be done simply, as land must, under Thai law, be in the wife’s, or some other Thai national’s name.</p>

  <p class="indent">All this happened while he was back in Edmonton, on a final trip to tie up all the loose ends, sell his house and car, put the dog to sleep, and say farewell to friends and family. Then it was a return to Thailand and his loving young wife, to complete the retirement move he had been planning and saving for over the past few years. On his return, and finding out just what had happened, he contacted the local police. Later, with the help of a Thai lawyer, he did get his now ex-wife into court. In true Thai fashion, she was found guilty only of a minor offence relating to the transfer of the house.</p>

  <p class="indent">She was ordered to pay him half the value of the house and half the amount in the joint bank accounts they had. This was to be completed within ten years. However, by this time the money had either been spent or perhaps was in some Thai boyfriend’s account, and the house was in her parent’s name. This had all happened three years before we were contacted, and in that whole time, he had not received a single baht from her in compensation. By now 63 years old, he didn’t feel like waiting around for another seven years just to see if any of his hard-earned retirement money would be getting refunded. We had our own lawyers go over all the legal documents and court findings, to no avail. The end result: he was screwed.</p>

  <p class="indent">He obviously, and with good cause, had brooded over this for some time. He advised us that he wanted our lawyers to be prepared to seize her assets immediately when she, his ex-wife, inherited the property from her parents. We mentioned the small matter that both parents had to be dead for this to happen. “So arrange it then,” was his reply.</p>

  <p class="indent">Even though we felt for him, we could no longer be involved, other then to simply warn him against doing anything rash or stupid. We did mention that we would monitor the health of his ex-wife’s parents, as in our position we can’t be even remotely involved with planned “accidents”.</p>

  <p class="indent">Certainly, hit men are available throughout many parts of Asia. Thailand is no exception. In my earlier days, through corrupt Thai associates as well as my knowledge of Cambodia and the Khamen language, I certainly knew where to find them. Cambodian army or former Khmer Rouge operatives would regularly cross the border on such missions, while for a more reliable hit, the eastern seaboard city of Chonburi had the dubious distinction of being something of a hitman’s haven, a small hotel in nearby Baeng Saen being a well-known meeting point.</p>

  <p class="indent">Today, however, Thai laws and regulations are much tighter, and apart from in the movies, or the rare, usually monetarily motivated hit, drive-by assassinations are no longer common.</p>

  <p class="indent">One overly vindictive South African was very keen for us to perform a “hit” for him. Now usually we do not even meet with prospective clients, one reason being we ourselves may well be on the wrong end of some vindictiveness. This Yarpie, however, was very keen to meet and discuss his problem and more than happy to pay well. A time and place was arranged after some preliminary background checks had confirmed that he was indeed a successful businessman in his home country and that he had a very expensive condo in Soi Thonglor.</p>

  <p class="indent">Two of our security men were stationed nearby when we went to meet up. From his appearance, however, this fellow was probably more in need of security than was our man. With designer clothes, a Rolex (and presumably not a cheap Chatujak Market fake either), a large diamond ring and an obnoxious- looking gold chain round his neck clasping a diamond-studded medallion, he looked like some high-class pimp, but, hey, whatever turns you on. As a rule, however, openly flaunting wealth in countries like Thailand is not very smart.</p>

  <p class="indent">He explained the position (well, his version of it anyway) to us in this way: He had been due to head to the airport, as he had to spend a few weeks checking up on his business commitments back in Cape Town before again returning to relax in Bangkok. He had left his Thai girlfriend (his choice of words, although perhaps paid-for-companion or, as Bernard Trink would say, “demimondaine” was a more accurate description) in the apartment while he went down to the office, paid some bills and locked up his car.</p>

  <p class="indent">Apparently, when he went back up to his condo to pick up his bags, the girl, who in standard Thai girlfriend fashion was supposed to have accompanied him to the airport, was gone. The demimondaine was not all that was missing. Also gone, so he said, was about US$2,000 in cash, US$3,000 in gold and jewellery, plus 200,000 Thai baht that he was about to put into the condo safe. As he had to be at the airport, he said that he didn’t have time to go to the police, so he hailed a taxi and thought he would sort things out when he returned a few weeks later.</p>

  <p class="indent">We are well aware that a client’s version of events may often differ from the actual facts. However, although there were a number of question marks surrounding his narrative, as usual, we could only question them and move on. Just why you would have that much cash on hand, and in plain view, is itself questionable. However, he said he often left large sums of money around, and she never took any notice. He said he had even tested her at times, leaving an exact amount of cash on a bedside cabinet and his lady friend had never touched anything.</p>

  <p class="indent">“She only had to ask if she needed anything,” he said. “I gave her plenty of spending money and even built a house for her family.”</p>

  <p class="indent">It was pointed out to him that now that she had shown her true colours, he was fortunate not to have married the girl: she may well have ended up with the condo and 50% of his wealth! This, however, was not what he wanted to hear. He had his own version of he truth: “She only took the money because her Thai boyfriend made her.” He then added, “I want him terminated.” Thai boyfriend, love triangles, revenge, “termination” – this was all getting a little sticky suddenly. We informed him that we certainly would not be involved in any acts of revenge he may have been contemplating and that it seemed like a straightforward case for the local police.</p>

  <p class="indent">We then tried to justify our time and meeting by explaining some of the ways and wherefores of Thai life, and said that while it was unfortunate, the best one could do was simply put it down to life’s experiences and move on. Certainly, being in Bangkok and throwing money around as he did, attracting a new girlfriend wouldn’t be any problem.</p>

  <p class="indent">He was, however, adamant on the revenge theme. “I heard it’s possible to buy a hit on someone for a few thousand dollars here,” he said. His emotional stability was now being seriously called into question. When told this was certainly something we would not be in any way involved with, he became quite irate, and stormed off a rather distressed and angry man.</p>

  <p class="indent">We assumed that was the last we would see of the Cape Town crusader, but alas, not so. Two weeks later, he again got into contact with us. This time he wanted us to find an Austrian man so we could “get his money back”. Just what money was this, we asked.</p>

  <p class="indent">He then told us how he had been put in touch with this man by a person he had met in a bar in Pattaya. He had been assured the guy could help him with his revenge problem. However, the due date of the hit had come and gone, and apparently the Thai boyfriend was still alive and well. In fact, he was even sporting a brand new motorbike. The only “hit” to speak of had been for another US$3,000 on the South African’s pocket! He was now offering to pay us even more money to track down the guy he had “donated” this latest payment to.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Cape Town kid was something of a loose canon, and certainly one we didn’t want to be involved with. Just where or who he is with now I have no idea, but he had the right type of attitude to get himself into some very serious trouble in a land he had little knowledge of or respect for. It never ceases to amaze me how people who may be very astute in the business or “real” world issues somehow seem to lose the plot when in Thailand – especially when confronted with nubile Thai lasses dancing around silver poles!</p>

  <p class="indent">As I often end up saying to male clients, when you arrive in Bangkok, you usually have a lot of money and are looking for a cute Thai girl who has some experience. By the time you leave, she has the money and you have had the experience.</p>

  <p class="indent">Of course, as we saw above, vindictiveness is not just a characteristic of the male of the species. We once received an email from a woman about a particular person who, according to her, was a danger to young girls.</p>

  <p class="indent">At Thai Private Eye, we obviously work closely with both local and international agencies when it seems required. More than once we have uncovered signs of paedophilia and immediately notified the relevant authorities. Of course, exactly what your definition of “young” is can differ, and when questioned, the client said the young ladies involved might have been in the 18 to 20-year-old bracket.</p>

  <p class="indent">Obviously, both our client and the intended quarry were much older. We didn’t bother to inform her that many street-smart Thai girls of that age have already acquired knowledge and experience of someone at least ten years older in the Western world. But we did carry out a little routine background check before we got involved in the case.</p>

  <p class="indent">Our female client had made bookings for the man, who was scheduled to attend a Bangkok seminar. Obviously, she knew of, or had researched, something of the city’s nightlife. She had provided us with his entire travel itinerary, down to the last detail, and we had assumed she was the worried wife. Getting what background we can on a client is important, as we wouldn’t be the first agency ever to be set up. Indeed, on a number of occasions, we have uncovered efforts to do just that, set us up or in some way make us the “fall guys”.</p>

  <p class="indent">Fortunately, her real name showed on her private email account which she had used to contact us. A simple check on the company website showed that the CEO of the company was in fact the target – and that the lady who contacted us was his personal secretary! Putting two and two together, we challenged her motives. She admitted that she hated the thought of her boss coming to Bangkok and running around loose in such a “den of iniquity”, as she termed it. Whether he had previously spurned her advances, or perhaps she just had a wish to take over his position, we did not know. But in any case, we told her quite firmly that we were not very taken with her attitude, and certainly would not take the case either.</p>
