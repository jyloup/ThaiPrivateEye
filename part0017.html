  <h2 class="chtitle" id="heading_id_2">BUT WHY?</h2>

  <p class="center">“It’s not the lies they tell you; it’s the lies we tell ourselves”</p>

  <p class="noindent">But why?” is a question that I was asked even more often during my years as the Thai Private Eye than I am these days by my inquisitive daughter; and she asks that one a lot. Martin, the client from the above tale, was yet another of the many to pose that question after he learnt the results of our meeting with Ree.</p>

  <p class="indent">This actually moves us into an area I have studied and, indeed, sometimes lecture on these days. Forgive me for breaking from the investigative reports and devoting a few pages to this topic, but it is, I think, important. I strongly believe anyone, male or female, Asian or Westerner, involved in a cross-cultural relationship, be it for business or pleasure, should have some idea of the background to the cultural and psychological differences involved. Here is what I passed onto Martin, to provide some explanation to his pained “why?”.</p>

  <p class="indent">I don’t profess to be a psycho-biologist, or even <i class="calibre5">au fait</i> with the works of people such as Nobel Prize winner Roger Sperry, who brought to notice the differences between the brains right and left hemispheres, but I did do some minor study, and also a research paper, that looked closely at these sticky matters.</p>

  <p class="indent">Being able to combine the wisdom of people such as Sperry and Richard Nisbett (whose book, <i class="calibre5">The Geography of Thought,</i> gives very good insights into the differences in thinking between Asians and Westerners) with what I had experienced myself over the many years spent in Thailand did give me perhaps a far better insight into the question of “why” than is possible for most other people without this grounding and experience.</p>

  <p class="indent">The simple fact is that many of my years in the Kingdom were indeed spent eating, drinking and conversing with the locals, basically living in the manner of a rather normal, even average, Thai citizen. Although I initially managed hotels, these were not trendy, multinational-owned and operated resorts, and often I was the only non-Thai on the staff. My years as an investigator were spent as much in small upcountry villages, or Bangkok slums, as they were at resorts or five-star hotels. I didn’t realize it at the time, but certainly during that period, my own epistemology, or way of thinking, changed accordingly.</p>

  <p class="indent">Just to give you an example: in the “Child’s Play” chapter earlier in the book, I spoke about my easy relationship with the bargirls at the After School and other nearby establishments. I regularly had cases or investigations centred around Soi Cowboy, so I knew the value of having a number of local working girls on my side whom I could casually ask for background on other girls in the area.</p>

  <p class="indent">Actually, over the years I had had two or three queries regarding girls who had worked at the After School Bar itself. Of course, the usual, easiest mode of investigation was simply to wander in, buy plenty of drinks, and then try and spot the girl under scrutiny, or casually ask where she was. Before long, I had become something of a regular and learnt that most of the girls working there were from Surin or Buriram.</p>

  <p class="indent">Therefore, they spoke the Cambodian dialect, Khamen, as well as Thai, and although in the class system that is quite prevalent amongst Thais, to speak Khamen labelled you as belonging to a lower class, it certainly never bothered me. This lack of regional chauvinism generally endeared me to the many working girls who hailed from that part of the country. It provided me with very good examples of how many Thai bargirls really are deeply insecure at heart, as I spoke to them in their native language and was viewed by many as a sort of big brother.</p>

  <p class="indent">So I can understand how difficult, if not impossible, it is for someone like Martin, for example, to put himself in the shoes of a Thai women whose family could only afford to educate her until she was 12, but who, in return, expect to rely on her for survival later in life.</p>

  <p class="indent">The interdependence of many Asians stands, of course, in direct contrast to the independent attitude of many Westerners. For instance, in much of Southeast Asia, pensions, unemployment benefits, child allowances, sickness benefits, redundancy payments or even divorce settlements are mostly nonexistent. Consequently, dependence on one’s family is much greater, and perhaps a reason that the belief in or need to fulfil family obligations remains paramount. These values of duty are, in fact, instilled in daughters even more than in the sons.</p>

  <p class="indent">One of the saddest phrases, albeit a common one, I would hear when doing the rounds of many Bangkok nightspots was <i class="calibre5">“Bua chawit”.</i> This broadly translates to “my life is boring”. Spoken in these circumstances, it becomes almost a wish to give up on their current life in the hope that the next one will be better. This type of attitude, certainly more Asian than Western, perhaps offers a key to unlocking that “why” that many puzzled Westerners keep asking.</p>

  <p class="indent">A major miss-conception (pun intended) Westerners tend to have about Asian women (or at least, about Thais) or, indeed, often about the Asian societies as a whole, is their apparent lack of morals.</p>

  <p class="indent">This is because so many Western visitors to Thailand are tourists who tend to spend much of their time visiting the nightlife districts. Temple visits are generally restricted to Bangkok’s Wat Phra Kaew, and the Emerald Buddha, or Chiang Ma’s famed Doi Suthep to take the obligatory photos. Visiting one of the Kingdom’s thousands of small rural temples at daybreak, learning what was going on there and why, would definitely show the local people in a far different light.</p>

  <p class="indent">Probably more so than in the West, one finds that peer pressure and a strong, but seldom spoken of, class system are forces that place Thais under added stress. A family in a small rural village may feel loss of face if a neighbour has donated more to the temple than they, or if that neighbour has a new TV. Education is also a cause for pressure; to be able to send your children to university, particularly a well-known one, is indeed something to tell your neighbours about, and to show you to advantage in the “one-upmanship” stakes that Asians hold so dear.</p>

  <p class="indent">The pressure to realise many of these aspirations again often falls primarily on the daughters in the family. The initial hope is often that your daughter will marry the son of a successful or wealthy local. More often than not, however, this plan fails and the daughter is sent to the city to find work and help support her family that way. The average Thai lady has very high moral standards. She would not consider going on a date without a chaperone, and intimacy is frowned upon, at least until an engagement has been announced. Certainly any public displays of affection are taboo. Drink, drugs, and peer pressure all tend to break these beliefs down, especially when a friend from the village, or a blood relative, has crossed that huge divide and entered the night trade. Frequently, these young women initially take that big step into the night trade as singers or karaoke hostesses. Or perhaps they will take on the status of a <i class="calibre5">mia noi</i> (a “minor” or show wife) that is a common occurrence in the Kingdom.</p>

  <p class="indent">And that is the beginning of a very slippery slope. In many cases, endless requests from their families for money along with the desire to have the same accessories their friends have – such as new mobile phones, trendy clothes, and, sadly, very much needed drugs – complete the breakdown of those morals.</p>

  <p class="indent">Once a Thai woman has crossed that boundary and entered the night trade, entered hotel rooms, she resigns herself to what she considers her fate. She will realize she no longer has any hope of marrying the wealthy Thai man her family had planned on, and also that she has failed many Buddhist teachings or beliefs, and hence has wasted or ruined this particular life. Her only salvation, she will tend to believe, is to continue to send money to help her family or siblings so that they will not have to tread the same path. By doing this, she may well become a better person, with better fortune, in the next life.</p>

  <p class="indent">Working in the night trade, as any psychologist will tell you, also places a lot of stress on those concerned, and this is magnified when that person is young and poorly educated. Alcohol and drugs are the common and easy ways to make it through from day to day, from hotel room to hotel room As I learned from my “big-brother” conversations with many bargirls, in most cases the drink and drug-taking was just a mask to cover up tangled feelings of disgust, or to help them survive in that rather dubious occupation. With their self-esteem at a very low ebb, these Thai girls have but one avenue of regaining some pride or self-satisfaction. That is the knowledge that they are pretty and therefore admired by older, wealthier, and (supposedly) far better educated men.</p>

  <p class="indent">From wonder bras to plastic surgery, these girls will do what they can to enhance their physical appeal, or to at least continue to draw those admiring glances from the opposite sex. In Ree’s case, her self-esteem had perhaps dwindled to zero. Her brothers led good, honest, hard-working lives, but she had let her family down. She knew the husband they had earmarked for her would not even consider someone like her now.</p>

  <p class="indent">Possibly numbed by a combination of debt and drugs, Ree felt that she had suddenly been given a chance at her 15 minutes of dubious fame. She had become someone who was admired, albeit by the wrong people for the wrong reasons. Certainly going off with Martin would have been a much wiser choice, and no doubt could have helped Ree to a far better life. However, she was at a stage where she had written this life off: <i class="calibre5">“Bua chawit.”</i> Thus, a combination of her fragile emotional state, of various psychological pressures, and ancient beliefs had caused her to make one bad decision after another. And that’s the sad but inescapable answer to the big “why?”.</p>

  <p class="indent">I could understand why she had treated Martin like a ship in the night. She would have appreciated his interest, but probably felt she wasn’t really good enough for him on a permanent basis, and also she was enjoying her bit of fame as well as the money and freedom she had at the moment. I can also see how he would struggle to understand why she didn’t take the wonderful opportunity he could have offered her. Hopefully, understanding this background helped to answer Martin’s and many other disillusioned Western suitors’ query as to “why?”.</p>

  <p class="indent">So ends the lesson. I’m not sure if it would sail through graduate school, but without doubt, being a Thai private eye certainly provides a very good grounding in basic psychology!</p>
