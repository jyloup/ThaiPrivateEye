  <p class="center">“Even a blind cat can stumble over a dead mouse sometimes.”</p>

  <p class="noindent">A further advancement for the company these days is that we do employ quite a few fully trained and qualified Thai operatives. This makes the way easier for surveillance on subjects in suburbia, or in small upcountry villages where, in the past, I often carried out investigations myself and felt at times that I stood out like a miniskirt in a monastery.</p>

  <p class="indent">One particular case we handled shows how important it can be to have multiple operatives. A successful Pattaya businessman, a Thai national, contacted us. He had heard good reports about our firm, he said. Plus, he was aware that some of the less scrupulous amongst our local competition did not always put their clients’ best interests first!</p>

  <p class="indent">A friend had spotted his wife with her former boyfriend, and mentioned it to him, so he had queried her about it. His wife’s answer was that she was being stalked by her ex. The husband was not totally sure, so our brief was to confirm if his wife was indeed being stalked, in which case we could gather evidence for him to provide to the police. Or, if his suspicions had some ground to them, we could find if the two were continuing their former affair. Betting man that I am, I was making the latter a fairly warm favourite for the truth!</p>

  <p class="indent">Considering all the variables one faces tailing people, along with the fact that the client was happy to pay good money to get the case settled quickly, we opted to use two rental cars, one just as a back-up, and also to have a motorcycle on standby. Thai number plates have the region of registration on them as well as the number, so to remain as inconspicuous as possible, we always rent locally.</p>

  <p class="indent">Four of our Thai agents were on hand, one female. The controlling agent went along on the job as well, and doubled up as the video cameraman. We, of course, knew the day’s proposed plans for our client’s wife – well, at least as far as taking their children to and from school as well as the route she would take on that particular chore. Why, therefore, so much manpower for what seemed a simple observation job? Because you can never discount the pervasive power of Murphy’s Law!</p>

  <p class="indent">The Staff assignments were set out in the following way: Car #1 and driver: Keep eyes on the subject’s car at all times, even when it is parked.</p>

  <p class="indent">Spotter: This was the lady of the team, seated in the back behind the passenger seat, so she remained out of view of the subject, just in case we happened to get too close. Also, she would be able to quickly get out of the vehicle and onto the pavement if, for any reason, foot pursuit were required.</p>

  <p class="indent">Video cameraman/Control: In the back of the car and available as back-up foot pursuit.</p>

  <p class="indent">Motorcyclist: A further back-up, just in case there was too much traffic and we lost the subject, or if we needed to transport the spotter somewhere in a hurry.</p>

  <p class="indent">Car #2 and driver: Kept in the vicinity in case our Car #1 was recognized.</p>

  <p class="indent">Our team was all in place when the client called in at 7:30 am on a typical hot and sunny Pattaya morning to inform us his wife had just left the house with the children. We knew the route she took to the school, and in any event, our interest was primarily in what she did after the children were dropped off. As is our procedure when possible, we had surveyed the area previously and determined that the best place to watch the school was in a small <i class="calibre5">soi</i> opposite the main gate that was actually the entranceway to a large housing estate. We knew the estate security guard might question us if we were there too long, but that was unlikely, and we did have our motorcyclist plus back-up car handy if we were asked to move. All was in readiness then.</p>

  <p class="indent">Shortly after 8 am, the team saw the children dropped off and that the driver was ready to move. The subject, however, make a quick U-turn and drove straight into the small side street we were parked in. The whole operation seemed compromised within two minutes! She, the subject, parked opposite us, got out and walked straight in front of our car. Our driver gazed at the gear lever, the spotter ducked down with her head on the lap of the cameraman, who at that point probably wished that the new, young and good-looking girl had been brought along instead of the somewhat older, chubbier one. At times like this, you always wonder just how effective those tinted windows we try to have our vehicles fitted with actually are.</p>

  <p class="indent">Tension, followed by a sort of controlled panic, hit our team. What had gone wrong to be “made” that early in the investigation was the question they were all thinking, but didn’t dare ask. Finally, daring a glance in the rear-view mirror, the driver was greeted with a startling sight.</p>

  <p class="indent">Our client’s wife was getting into another car, parked just a few metres behind his. The car certainly hadn’t been there a few moments earlier – so using great powers of deduction, our driver surmised that the vehicle must have come from within the housing estate.</p>

  <p class="indent">Slowly, the team’s heart rates returned to somewhere near normal, training kicked in, a cross-check of case notes with the vehicle seen in the rear-view mirror, in which the subject was now seated, confirmed it was in fact the vehicle owned by her former boyfriend, the alleged “stalker”. We had been given details of his vehicle’s colour and make, but not the registration plate number, which, had we had it, would have given us his address. Far than being compromised, within half an hour we had confirmed that the woman was indeed meeting voluntarily with her ex. Sometimes things do just fall into place!</p>

  <p class="indent">Being suddenly so close to a subject can be a little troubling, but it does, of course, make for good video footage, and the static covert camera unit placed in the rear window certainly did its job well. Soon thereafter, the woman went back to her car, made another U-turn, and then followed the alleged stalker out to the main road, tailing the rapidly disappearing boyfriend’s vehicle.</p>

  <p class="indent">Having a back-up car proved a wise precaution, as it was able to take over our careful pursuit of the woman. After all, she had clearly seen the original car and, possibly, the driver as well. With spotter and cameraman transferred to car #2, they set off to see what further eventuated.</p>

  <p class="indent">The original driver was dispatched to the rental car company to swap vehicles, and return to the area. Like many of our drivers, Agent #2 doubled as a taxi driver when not working for us, so catching up and settling into a standard pursuit pattern was not too much of a problem. That is, until the subjects suddenly both took a right turn at an amber light and headed up a side road. Even our back-up motorcyclist missed that manoeuvre, so for all our tight planning, it seemed we had lost them.</p>

  <p class="indent">Just as our team cursed its bad luck, the two vehicles re-appeared. They had obviously taken a wrong turn, and were now heading back in the direction they had started out from. A bit confusing, but it was another lucky break – which in our business, you need to make the most of.</p>

  <p class="indent">Without being asked, our driver showed off some deft Bangkok taxi driver skills: a screech of tires, a cloud of blue smoke, and we were back on the chase. So much for trying to remain covert! It took a kilometre or two, but before long, the targets were back in view. No sooner had that happened, than both the vehicles we were tracking made yet another U-turn. It seemed they were deliberately trying to shake off any would-be tails! Control thought perhaps it was time to call the day’s surveillance off, when wife and “stalker” both pulled into a petrol station almost opposite our car. Apparently, lack of petrol (and not abundance of caution) was the reason for the latest turn in their erratic route.</p>

  <p class="indent">Our spotter lady scurried over to use the petrol station’s toilets and got some good pictures of the pair on her mobile phone, then hurried back as the woman left her vehicle and climbed into the boyfriend’s car. They then drove right past our team, back towards the school. Control sent the motorcyclist to track them, then joined up with the driver and spotter as they went into the petrol station for a coffee and to see how the photographic evidence was looking.</p>

  <p class="indent">Things really started to make sense when we saw an attendant begin washing the woman’s car. Control took his coffee back to the vehicle and called up the client, while our driver and spotter did as any Thais do when they have a chance: they went and found a food vendor. The client, somewhat subdued upon hearing that stalking was out of the equation, assured us his wife had no reason to believe she was being followed, then agreed that the motorcyclist surveillance and a watch on the car at the garage continue until his wife’s return. The motorcyclist was called, and reported that the pair had stopped at a nearby shopping mall and were themselves having a coffee and what appeared to be a rather unhappy discussion. He added that he had then ducked out for a toilet break, and when he came back, the couple had gone. Perhaps not the ideal work ethic; however, this being Thailand, there was little Control could do other than to say <i class="calibre5">“Mai pen rai”. (Mai pen rai</i> is a frequently used Thai phrase that translates as “never mind” or “don’t worry about it”. This is the Thai attitude to many problems, which foreigners often have to struggle to adapt to.)</p>

  <p class="indent">Control had just finished speaking to the motorcyclist when a car pulled into the parking space beside him. It was the boyfriend! This was one of those times you start to wonder why you are in the investigative profession: the hairs stand up on the back of your neck and the minutes tick by very slowly. Panicky thoughts rush through your mind: is he waiting for some Thai heavies to arrive? Will he get out in a minute, come over and start hammering on the car door? Where is the woman?</p>

  <p class="indent">Control kept still and, he hoped (courtesy of the tinted windows), out of sight. He was slightly consoled knowing that two staff members were nearby; supposedly. Were they intent on their food, were they being cool, or had they perhaps inadvertently tipped the guy off? You start to look around for a weapon and wonder why you don’t carry a flick knife or pepper spray. About this time, whether it was just nerves or that last coffee, our prime man really needed a toilet break himself. But just as he was contemplating the idea of slipping out the other side door, a car pulled into that spot, driven by the women. Out of his view, she had collected her vehicle from the car wash. The boss man, our Control agent, was now well and truly hemmed in. He crouched down in the rear seat, his bladder close to bursting, the car’s air-con off and windows up, sweat dripping off him at a far heavier rate than it would at any of the city’s better known sauna establishments.</p>

  <p class="indent">However, surprisingly to him, both suspects remained oblivious to his presence. He actually could not have been in a better position now, as far as gaining evidence was concerned. The woman had walked over and was seated in the boyfriend’s car. Peering cautiously through the tinted window, Control saw them in a deep and, at times, heated discussion. The camera’s zoom showed her deep in thought while the guy was doing the ranting and raving, even banging the steering wheel with his fist. It did, of course, make for some great footage! Finally, she got out of the vehicle, and her ex – no, better make that “still” – boyfriend, quickly reversed out, driving off in what could only be called a huff. The women slowly ambled back to her vehicle and also drove away.</p>

  <p class="indent">Control was at that point far more concerned with getting to the toilet than bothering to pursue them further. Besides, what had originally been estimated as a two- or three-day job had by good luck rather than good management been completed in just a few hours. A text message on Control’s phone indicated that the number plate of the boyfriend’s vehicle had been confirmed, along with his home address, which was, indeed, in the estate opposite the school.</p>

  <p class="indent">The client was updated with the news. Happy with the progress, if not the result, he was going to confront the pair just as soon as he had contacted his bank and blocked his wife’s access to further cash. He believed he had probably financed the old boyfriend’s car and even the house, as it was. He was asked if he wanted some back-up or moral support, but thankfully declined; he said he had a very intimidating driver of his own. We don’t like to get involved in Thai domestic disputes if we can avoid them, so we just saw him at the office the next day when he picked up a detailed DVD.</p>

  <p class="indent">He told us that at least for now, and for the child’s sake, he and his missus would remain together. He was, of course, depressed to learn of the outcome; who wouldn’t be? It was now apparent his wife had been milking him for years and supporting her “former” boyfriend with some of the flow. It had only been a chance sighting of them by that friend that had resulted in him contacting us.</p>

  <p class="indent">He was also able to shed some light on the pair’s demeanour the previous day. His wife, he told us, had been on the phone to him, reminding him of the 300,000 baht he had agreed to give her to open a cosmetics business. He had then told her he had changed his mind, and they could discuss it later. Obviously, he had contacted us just in time, as no doubt much of the money was earmarked for the boyfriend, to prop up his own faltering company.</p>

  <p class="indent">It’s not often that things all fall into place so simply, but it certainly makes for a refreshing change when they do, as in this case. Of course, the case control agent, who probably aged a year or two within minutes and lost a number of kilos during the morning’s activities, may not totally agree with our assessment of how simply things worked out in this case.</p>
