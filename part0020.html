  <p class="center1">Thai Private Eye maxim<br class="calibre4"/>
  <br class="calibre4"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">There are a number of places in Southeast Asia which have the distinction of being something of a haven for those with other than heterosexual tendencies. Thailand is clearly one. I guess I had a fair insight into the Thai perspective on this, and could work out some of the whys and wherefores behind this phenomenon.</p>

  <p class="indent">You must consider that it is common for the Thai father or husband to be either away working in the city, or perhaps to have simply “fled the scene”. Add to this the fact that a young boy or brother is particularly revered in Thai society, to the point where they are often spoilt and constantly hugged and cuddled by friends and family, particularly mothers or sisters, and the foundations for encouraging somewhat effeminate behaviour later in life are perhaps laid back there in the home.</p>

  <p class="indent">I found in my travels that lesbianism was quite common amongst young girls working in bars and clubs. More often than not, this had stemmed from too many “broken hearts” caused by the opposite sex, or else fulfilling a need to have someone close who understood their particular wants, needs, and fears, something that an older, foreign beau could not. Unlike Westerners, who often value some time alone, many Thais tend to have a fear of being on their own, particularly at night!</p>

  <p class="indent">Thais are also particularly prone to “wearing their hearts on their sleeve” and emotionally seem to mirror the ups and downs of the local daily soap operas, to which many are addicted. Sure, there are those who have become hardened, almost mechanical, over the years. But for many, their relationships tend to resemble walking on eggshells rather than steady and stable affairs. Drama Queen is a term that, for better or worse, can be applied to many Thai ladies of the night. It is quite common to spot a few “slash” marks on a pretty young girl’s wrists, and on a few occasions, even I had the dubious honour of having such a mark pointed out and told “this one because of you!” Of course, in true Thai style, the slashes are rarely as deep as the ones I give myself shaving, but you get the point.</p>

  <p class="indent">There are also many instances in the Bangkok night scene of heterosexuals changing their outlook or preference, simply for the better monetary opportunities it may offer. It was not uncommon, therefore, for Thai Private Eye to be contacted to look into certain cases or relationships that were of a homosexual nature. Of course, there were also times, such as in the intriguing “Case of the Reluctant Virgin” detailed in my earlier book, <i class="calibre5">Confessions of a Bangkok Private Eye,</i> where the client was unknowingly in such a relationship!</p>

  <p class="indent">In the following case, however, it was clear that everyone knew very well just what was going on, at least from a sexual point of view. It did also, for better or worse, provide the agent assigned the case quite an insight (dare I say even more than he wanted) into the goings on in some of the city’s gay bars. This story lets you share some of what he learnt there.</p>

  <p class="indent">First, let me say that I, and indeed all those at Thai Private Eye, are fairly broadminded, and in no way judgmental about anyone’s sexuality or sexual preferences. I apologize if I offend anyone with this case or the rather explicit details with which our assigned agent was confronted at times. But hey, this book is based on actual cases as they happened, so you need to know the facts! We do certainly find ourselves in all types of situations, and I can only repeat, after a good many years in the trade, that nothing surprises me these days.</p>

  <p class="indent">We received an email asking us for advice and help in a case involving a man and his 20-year-old Thai male lover. According to the client, they had met in a male go-go bar in the Patpong Soi 4 area of Bangkok, a well-known haven for the gay fraternity.</p>

  <p class="indent">In the same manner as often happens to Western male tourists meeting girls working in the bars and clubs on the adjacent <i class="calibre5">sois</i> or lanes around Patpong, these two soon became more seriously involved, to the extent that the Thai lad had convinced our client it would be a great idea to open a beauty salon in Bangkok that he would manage for him. This seemed like a sound idea, as it would get the young Adonis away from the clutches of the bar’s many customers and hopefully allow him to earn a more legitimate salary.</p>

  <p class="indent">Being a successful businessman himself, our client was not totally naive, and he wanted to get some confirmation that his investment, which would possibly total quite a few thousand of Uncle Sam’s dollars, was not going to be wasted.</p>

  <p class="indent">The initial part of the investigation therefore was to ascertain that the Thai toy boy was at least carrying out his part of the bargain. This meant to cease working in the gay bar scene and to attend a beautician school to acquire the necessary knowledge and certificates. I had carried out many similar requests for clients checking on Thai girls allegedly intent on heading down a similar straight and narrow path and, in most instances, ended up having to report that the call of the bar was generally more powerful than the call of the beautician school. I wondered if things were any different as far as Thai males were concerned. I had previously carried out a few minor investigations for Western men checking out Thai males, but in most of those cases, they either concealed “ the target’s background or their own particular reason of interest.</p>

  <p class="indent">We had previously not had the need or urge to take a closer look at Bangkok’s gay club community. However, as the city had the perhaps dubious claim to being the sex capital of the world, we were in no doubt it would be full-on, with all tastes well catered for. Indeed, even just wandering around the Patpong night markets, one is continuously tapped on the shoulder and asked, “You want lady?” If, for whatever reason, you happen to answer “No, thanks”, you can be sure of an immediate follow-up question: “You want boy?”</p>

  <p class="indent">Allowing for the flocks of customers such places undoubtedly draw, not to mention the stigma of various diseases associated even more with homosexuals, it was not surprising then that as our client was a very caring guy, he wanted to see his new love get out of his current environment ASAP. To quote again a well-known TPE maxim, “You know you’re in love when you don’t want your girl (or boyfriend) hanging around in the place you met her or him!”</p>

  <p class="indent">Case accepted, we then had our own internal problem to deal with. Although we have what we consider a wide range of agents, of different races, both full-time and casual, as far as we are aware, none of them happened to be both Westerners and gay. Or Asian and gay, for that matter. It’s no problem at all finding an agent willing to sit in a normal go-go bar and try and see if a particular girl is working or “available”. However, in this case, we needed someone to spend perhaps a fair amount of time in the city’s gay bars, and what’s more, appear as though he were totally enjoying the experience!</p>

  <p class="indent">We are very particular about those we employ, and also make sure that they are well trained in our methods and procedures, so taking a chance on a casual outsider with bona fide gay credentials was not something we would consider. Instead, we put out a sort of call for volunteers amongst those agents we had who at least looked as though they might fit the gay mode.</p>

  <p class="indent">It took some talking, along with an offer of a bonus, to convince one of our younger agents to take on the job. His main concern was not that he’d be thought of as having homosexual tendencies, which he certainly did not, but that he would, in fact, be found out when in a gay bar or club as not being a … bona fide “member of the fraternity” is perhaps the phrase to use. He was afraid that if he were somehow “outed”, he might suffer a whipping or some other unwanted form of beating, bondage or domination! We assured him we would have ample back-up stationed in the immediate area in case this problem ever looked like it might materialize, and also made a point of swearing the client to secrecy regarding the investigation. Any hint to his new partner that he may be checked up on, would, of course, have the toy boy even more on the alert for someone such as our agent. The client was duly reminded that it was imperative he act as normal as possible while the investigation was being conducted on his boyfriend, which he completely understood and vowed to do.</p>

  <p class="indent">The first phase of the investigation was simply to visit the club and see if the subject was still working there and perhaps even try to determine if he was still plying his trade. He may have been sitting at home being honest and faithful, but if the men working in Bangkok’s entertainment scene were anything like the girls, it was most unlikely, we figured, that he was in any haste to be chaste.</p>

  <p class="indent">I had arranged for a contact of mine, who was a <i class="calibre5">katooey,</i> or transvestite, to spend a few hours with our selected agent (who was now known as Jay Jay), perhaps take him shopping, and answer any basic questions he might have. Cross-dressing “Annie” was something of a classic. When a friend had first introduced him/her to me in the dimness of the trendy Spasso nightclub one evening, it hadn’t even dawned on me that “she” was not the attractive, well-groomed, articulate Thai women she seemed to be – and it certainly hadn’t dawned on this other friend!</p>

  <p class="indent">I did overhear a whisper or two in Thai that first raised my doubts, so out of curiousity I had taken the opportunity to perform my “arm test” on Annie later that evening. In the arm test, you ask the person being tested to thrust an arm out straight. When a male holds his arm out straight from the shoulder, in the manner of throwing a “straight left”, it will indeed form an almost straight line. With a female performing the same act, the arm will actually bend back slightly beyond the 360° angle at the elbow joint.</p>

  <p class="indent">Afterwards, I told Annie that “she” was the best-looking “lady-boy” I had ever seen, adding in confidence that I would keep her gender to myself. When asked what I did for a living, I gave “her” my usual line, that I helped people with visa or immigration problems. This, of course, perked up the interest of Thai girls who tended to mix with foreigners, as most had offers or queries about overseas travel. After that, I did have the odd call for advice from Annie on such matters, and there were also occasions, such as the present one, when I was able to call on “her” for some ideas.</p>

  <p class="indent">Accordingly, Jay Jay was as well-briefed and prepared as we could manage, and so the following evening, with two of our Thai martial arts experts sitting at a nearby food stall sharing some noodles, he somewhat gingerly dipped his toe into the waters of the Patpong gay bar scene. Almost identical to the bars a <i class="calibre5">soi</i> or two further down Silom Road, a central catwalk with chrome poles was the focal point of this particular establishment. The catwalk itself was surrounded by some comfortable swivel chairs for those who wanted to be close up, whilst sofas and discreet booths were placed a little further back.</p>

  <p class="indent">Jay Jay opted for a sofa, ordered a drink, and in due course was approached by a muscular young Thai guy wearing nothing other than tight white boxer shorts and baby oil. The bulge inside the shorts left little to the imagination as to what was on offer! The guy asked if he could join our intrepid agent for a drink, an offer Jay Jay politely refused. He didn’t want to get chatty with anyone if it could be helped, except possibly the subject of the investigation.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Village People and the Backstreet Boys pumped out a stream of foot-tapping music as groups of around a dozen young guys at a time took to the catwalk and gyrated around the poles, wearing only posing pouches. They spent twenty or thirty minutes showing off their moves and trying to catch the eye of any potential drink buyer or customer before being replaced by another fresh set of young Asian Adonises.</p>

  <p class="indent">Jay Jay struggled through a couple of excruciating hours, having to buy an occasional drink and chat with various admirers, but as far as he was aware, there was no sign of the subject. Once certain he had seen all the guys in the club who took to the catwalk that evening, he bade his newfound friends farewell, and beat a hasty retreat. It was possible our client’s lad had indeed retired from the club scene. Then again, perhaps he was just taking a night off, or even holidaying with yet another sponsor. For now, however, there was no sighting, so Jay Jay was happy to get outside, back to the type of bar and surroundings he was more comfortable with, and fill his interested co-workers in on the intricate details of the action inside a gay bar.</p>

  <p class="indent">The apparent highlight of the evening, or so Jay Jay informed us, was the floor show: several naked young men descending a flight of multi-coloured stairs with nothing but an “Egyptian cock ring” around the base of their very erect penises! Although to me that accessory sounded like something to be found around the leg of a bird at a cock fight, our new expert on such matters, agent Jay Jay, explained that the dancers taking part in the floor show used the device to prolong their erections, as the rubber Egyptian ring stopped the flow of blood once the penis was erect. It was obvious that the guys placed the rings on first, then they all must have stimulated each other together in order to get an erection, so that they all came down the stairs together; something like synchronized swimming Jay Jay reckoned!</p>

  <p class="indent">He said it made him feel uncomfortable, so he reckoned it was even more so for those taking part, who had proceeded to present their manhood to the first row of male onlookers for closer inspection. This, of course, was well received by the customers, except for Jay Jay, who supposedly tried not to look too interested! Of course, customers could then sort of hand pick which dancer they would like to have join them for a drink – or discuss some extracurricular activities with.</p>

  <p class="indent">The show, however, was certainly not yet over. It continued with naked men being suspended from the ceiling by chains and/or strapped into a sort of gynaecologist’s chair while others simulated (he hoped) having anal and oral sex with them on stage. As in Bangkok’s Girlie bars, all the boys had numbers so you could order the one of your choice; perhaps in a combination deal with a cocktail, I suggested!</p>

  <p class="indent">These numbers, which the dancers retained for their whole career at that establishment, helped customers recall a particular performer and also proved very handy for private eyes trying to confirm if a subject was still working at a venue. The fact that there was no appearance by Number 18 had convinced Jay Jay that the young man being checked up on was not working that night – at least, not in that particular club.</p>

  <p class="indent">We suggested to Jay Jay that he should perhaps return one more time, but he made it clear he saw that as above and beyond the bounds of duty, then reminded us of a comment made when we had first taken him on board: “We won’t ask you to do anything we wouldn’t do ourselves.” That then effectively ended Phase One, so we moved onto the next stage of the investigation.</p>

  <p class="indent">This began with a basic surveillance of the beautician training academy in Siam Square, and we were soon able to verify that the subject was, in fact, attending the course daily, so at least he was keeping his word as far as that part of the agreement was concerned. Whether he had completely severed his links with the excitement of the gay club and sex scene was another question altogether. After some discussion with our client, we decided to conduct a covert surveillance of the lad’s apartment to wrap up our investigation.</p>

  <p class="indent">After three days of constant surveillance, tracking the subject when we could, it was not at all surprising to us to discover he was indeed working elsewhere. He had been clever enough to assume that possibly his newfound sponsor would ask some acquaintances to call by the original club just to see if Number 18 was still strutting his stuff. He had obviously not counted on this sponsor hiring a team of professionals to do the job! From the outside, his new place of work seemed innocuous enough. However, knowing Thailand as we do, we knew better than to always take things at face value.</p>

  <p class="indent">At first glance, the establishment seemed to be little more than a fitness and bodybuilding club. However, when two of our agents approached the entrance, one casually holding a video camera and the other asking a few questions, they were very quickly turned away. Obviously, that only fuelled our interest in the club, so we switched to a different approach. Thanks to open source information and the world of the Net, we soon found the club’s small website and a number to call for information. There we discovered that the club had a wide range of offerings for the discerning male wanting some discreet and exotic fitness-oriented activities, including a large number of vitamins and various substances – all guaranteed to enlarge, prolong, improve, and enhance the activities of the pertinent body parts.</p>

  <p class="indent">A somewhat reluctant Jay Jay was then called in again to resume his role. A call was made to the club, mention was made of a “friend’s” very high recommendation, and Jay Jay’s name was noted. He was told to report to the club that evening and give his name to the doorman, who would be happy to allow him entry as a non-member for a mere US$20.</p>

  <p class="indent">Using another of our agents, one who doubled as a taxi driver and was able to park nearby, Jay Jay was delivered to the club which was situated across the Chao Phraya River in the Pin Gow district, not too far from the well-known Wat Arun, the temple of dawn. But as Jay Jay was soon to learn, what the customers at this club were watching rise, certainly wasn’t the sun.</p>

  <p class="indent">The club’s theme was bodybuilding exercises on a stage with simulated sex acts. Along with the various steroids and other bodybuilding drugs available, Jay Jay was left in no doubt as to how fit and strong many of the performers were. He was soon able to identify the subject, who was not yet as muscled up as many of his colleagues, but who was definitely up to par on the simulated sex moves! Jay Jay noted that some clients disappeared upstairs with staff, so there obviously were “short-time” rooms available for those who couldn’t wait to test some of the products, or personnel, on offer. Although he certainly was not going to make an offer to test the sexual prowess of our client’s boyfriend, he was in no doubt as to his availability.</p>

  <p class="indent">Apart from watching the ongoing show, Jay Jay politely spurned all offers of membership deals and the array of both boys and stimulants made to him before making his exit as soon as possible.</p>

  <p class="indent">The staff appeared rather cautious, and Jay Jay’s main fear was that somehow his cover would be blown. No doubt what regularly happens when we are out and about is that there are those working in the venues other than our particular client’s interests, who are likewise doing so against a sponsor’s wishes and are alert to the possibility of being checked on. Having seen the fitness levels and muscles of the club staff, Jay Jay was well aware he could have been dealt with rather severely had they been given any reason to suspect his motives. Their caution was, however, perhaps more related to the various drugs and stimulants they stocked, as this booming market had recently been the cause of a number of power struggles within the Kingdom. I myself had been involved in probing a little more deeply into the murder in Pattaya of a New Zealander who had just possibly been trying to undercut some rather more powerful suppliers. All in all, it was a very relieved Jay Jay who exited the club safe, sound and intact, vowing his days as an undercover agent in any gay bar, club or gay-oriented establishment were over once and for all.</p>

  <p class="indent">A report was then compiled, all relevant footage put on a DVD and forwarded to the client, whom we assumed would, like any businessman deceived by a potential partner, be very quickly walking away from any future deals. So much for our assumptions. We received a reply shortly thereafter telling us that when he questioned lover-boy, the lad claimed he had only gone to the club as he wanted to surprise his generous sponsor on his return to Bangkok with a fitter and more attractive body.</p>

  <p class="indent">Our client closed by asking if we could suggest a good lawyer to help him set up the proposed salon. We did think of asking him to update us with the location of the business so we could send an associate along for a facial, but I don’t think Jay Jay would have seen the coy humour in that gesture.</p>
