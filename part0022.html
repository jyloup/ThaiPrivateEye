  <h2 class="chtitle" id="heading_id_2">Acknowledgments</h2>

  <p class="noindent">I would like to especially thank the man who is now in charge at Thai Private Eye (and wishes to remain anonymous) for his help and friendship and for “casting an eye” over the more recent cases as I worked through them.</p>

  <p class="indent">My thanks also go out to those at Monsoon, especially Phil, who has been a great help to me in this somewhat different field (for me anyway) of writing and publication, and also Richard Lord, who as my editor had the sometimes unenviable task of putting clarity and tighter organisation into my occasionally wayward ramblings.</p>

  <p class="indent">Rob, the “wingman”, and other friends on our special forum have all offered advice and support. So to them also, my sincere thanks. Locally, PK, a close and valued friend, always there for my family and me: your support greatly appreciated. And, of course, my wife Goong, who does her best and helped me now, as she has done for many years, with her insight on things Thai, as seen from her perspective. And most of all, my daughter Natalie, who motivates me these days, and who is a daily reminder of the bright and beautiful things that can come out of the Land of Smiles.</p>
