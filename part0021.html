  <br class="calibre4"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">Let me start this chapter with a joke that seems quite fitting to the story that follows:</p>

  <p class="indent">A Mafia Godfather finds out that his bookkeeper has cheated him out of ten million dollars. His bookkeeper is deaf, the reason he got the job in the first place. It was assumed that a deaf bookkeeper would not hear anything that he might later have to testify about in court. The Godfather goes to confront the bookkeeper about his missing $10 million, and brings along his lawyer, who also knows sign language. The Godfather tells the lawyer to ask him where the 10 million dollars is.</p>

  <p class="indent">The lawyer, using sign language, duly asks the bookkeeper what he did with the money. The bookkeeper signs back that he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. The lawyer relays this to the Godfather, who then pulls out a pistol, puts it the bookkeeper’s temple and says, “Ask him again!”</p>

  <p class="indent">The Lawyer signs to the bookkeeper that he will be killed if he doesn’t come clean. The bookkeeper signs back, “Okay! You guys win! The money is in a brown briefcase, buried behind the shed in my backyard.”</p>

  <p class="indent">The Godfather asks the Lawyer what he said. The lawyer replies, “He says you don’t have the balls to pull the trigger.”</p>

  <p class="indent">The story that follows is not at all funny though. What I am about to detail here is the final case in this book, and perhaps even the final one I’ll ever be actively involved in. It is very current; in fact, it is still ongoing. It also happens to be somewhat “close-to-home” for me. Again, I can confirm that like all the others cases in this book, it is based totally on fact, but as you will understand in this case particularly, some names, locations and descriptions had to be altered due to the suspicions raised as well as the ongoing nature of investigations.</p>

  <p class="indent">Over a decade ago, a simple Thai family lived in one of the cheaper areas of Bangkok. The husband was a chauffeur while his wife stayed home and cared for their three daughters. Their problems started one night when the husband came home rather late, rather drunk, and assumed, perhaps quite rightly, that his wife was having an affair with a neighbour.</p>

  <p class="indent">The man had a handgun in his house, which he took with him as he went to confront the neighbour. In the ensuing fracas, the gun went off and the neighbour was badly injured, although not fatally. The police were called, and in due course, the chauffeur was sentenced to five years imprisonment.</p>

  <p class="indent">Things then became even more difficult for the family, and so the oldest daughter, who was then 19 and earning a meagre salary in a clothing factory, was encouraged by her mother to find a far more financially rewarding job – in a local massage parlour.</p>

  <p class="indent">Not too long thereafter, and presumably at her new place of work, the daughter met a somewhat older foreigner, who, as it happened, came from New Zealand. Although I never got to meet the man, I did get to know of him. This came as a result of one of those coincidences that seem to occur regularly in the Land of Smiles: When I married my Thai girlfriend some six or seven years after the above-mentioned massage parlour meeting, I learnt that my new wife was a relative of the family at the centre of this story. Hence my knowledge and understanding of the case. As well as my heightened interest.</p>

  <p class="indent">The man involved was a quiet, unassuming fellow who had spent his lifetime in the army and, in fact, was not too far away from retirement. He was no front-line, gun-toting officer, however. In fact, he was much more of a backroom boy, having even completed a law degree whilst in the army. His army duties were actually more in the field of law and related areas of adjudication. However, he had no immediate family.</p>

  <p class="indent">This fine gentleman became very fond of the younger girl, learnt something of her story, and as happens so often, wanted to help her and get her into a better field of employment. He rented her a nice apartment, sent her to learn English, spent all his holidays with her, and also sent her a monthly retainer.</p>

  <p class="indent">Approximately a year later, there was a major development: the girl became pregnant. Our army officer was happy at the prospect of his impending fatherhood, and so did all he could financially to help. He also confirmed that when he reached retirement age in another four or five years, he would settle permanently in Thailand. As the girl expressed a wish to be at home with her mother and younger sisters to help during her pregnancy, he found a better place of accommodation for them, and shortly thereafter, the former masseuse gave birth to a daughter.</p>

  <p class="indent">The little girl was fine and healthy, and all seemed well. Unfortunately, however, this appears to be a family continually beset by disaster. Not too long after the birth, a wayward taxi driven by a drunk driver hit the baby girl’s mother as she was walking along the road to her home, killing her.</p>

  <p class="indent">Though obviously very upset, there was not really too much the army man could do. He had no family of his own to care for the little one, and so naturally enough, she was then placed in the care of her grandmother, who brought her up as her own. Of course, this upbringing was helped by a steady stream of funds, and visits, from her elderly Kiwi father.</p>

  <p class="indent">In due course, when the girl was around seven years old, the father’s time in the army was up, and he was discharged, leaving with substantial payments and pensions. With little better to do, he kept his word and relocated to Thailand. Rather than live on the outskirts of Bangkok in a Thai-only neighbourhood, he decided to base himself down the highway, in Pattaya. There are a large number of expats living in this resort town, and the shopping malls, supermarkets and even hospitals there are very Westernised. All of which made the retired officer’s transition that much easier.</p>

  <p class="indent">He soon found a nice home on the outskirts of Pattaya, expensive by local standards: 3 million Thai baht. But the home had all the modern conveniences, even a swimming pool. He was soon introduced by the estate agent to a local lawyer, who completed the details. Upon learning of the man’s background, the lawyer became something of a local advisor to him. (The lawyer’s willingness to help was no doubt spurred by the New Zealander’s ability to buy such an expensive home. Now I’m not saying the law firm was the fabled Dewey, Screwem and Howe, but that does give you some idea as to how they are viewed in that part of the world!)</p>

  <p class="indent">Our now happily retired officer had regular visits from his daughter and saw that she had the best of schooling, and that her family also had money for food and clothing. (Although in many instances, it is possible that some of the food and clothing money got diverted into alcoholic beverages and gambling.)</p>

  <p class="indent">His new lawyer friend was happy to advise him on interests or activities to get involved in, and actually came up with a wonderful opportunity. This was the chance to join with the lawyer’s brother-in-law, a Danish chap, who was in the process of setting up a small menagerie or zoo where local and visiting youngsters could both learn about and get up close to Thailand’s native plants, animals and reptiles.</p>

  <p class="indent">Having a young daughter of his own, this greatly appealed to the New Zealander, and he clearly felt that travelling around Thailand and collecting the many exotic animals and reptiles was going to be an interesting and rewarding experience. Plans were then drawn up, the land had already been purchased, and the infrastructure work begun. As the Dane’s funds had waned, new investors were required, and in the retired army man, he had seemingly found a perfect and enthusiastic partner. In a further act of helpfulness, the Dane’s Thai wife had introduced the Kiwi to an older auntie, apparently a qualified nurse, who was happy to accompany their new partner on his travels. This was advisable, as the New Zealander was finding the heat rather exhausting at times, and perhaps his health overall was starting to fail a little.</p>

  <p class="indent">He arranged shortly thereafter for all his own funds and investments to be cashed up and transferred to Thailand, and he invested most of this into the new venture. He had a lifetime army pension that was now paid into his Thai account, and this more than covered his regular living expenses.</p>

  <p class="indent">These are the facts that I’ve uncovered bit by bit as I have worked through the case over the past few months. There were, in addition, two further very important facts that came to light. During one of the daughter’s regular weekend stays with her father and his new companion/ friend/ personal nurse, the trio had spent a day at the renowned Chatujack market and purchased a number of Thai water dragons, iguanas and even a snapping tortoise, which were temporarily being kept in the backyard of their home, awaiting permanent residence in the soon-to-be completed zoo.</p>

  <p class="indent">Over that weekend, the daughter had developed a fever, so as a precaution, she had been taken to the local hospital. At his nurse/companion’s request, and unbeknown to her father, a blood sample and associated DNA test were also requested at that time.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sometime after the hospital invoice was presented and test results finalized (perhaps when the New Zealander was discussing the future or inheritances with her), the nurse produced the DNA result, no doubt brushing it off as a standard test run by Thai hospitals. The test confirmed what perhaps deep down he had always known: he was not the little girl’s biological father.</p>

  <p class="indent">Just how this affected him, I will never know. He certainly cared very much for the little girl, and no doubt saw much of the girl’s mother in her. Perhaps, however, he harboured the feeling that the girl’s grandmother and her aunties, whom he had provided for very admirably over the years, had known the truth all along and had to some extent hidden that knowledge and abused his trust.</p>

  <p class="indent">The other fact to emerge from my research was even more tragic, especially as far as our benevolent Kiwi was concerned. A short time later, he was found dead in his own swimming pool by the nurse/companion, supposedly when she returned home from a shopping expedition. Even allowing for the fact that he was ailing, the death was most unexpected. Furthermore, it was a few days after the event that the man’s young daughter and her family were first notified, and, as I found out later, no postmortem was ever undertaken, or in fact even considered. The best official version I can get is that he had been unwell, he was old, and it was believed he had a heart attack whilst swimming alone in his pool and subsequently drowned. Death by natural causes?</p>

  <p class="indent">As I have found with deplorable regularity in similar instances, especially, it seems, cases that happen in Pattaya, there was a surprising lack of cash, gold or even bank funds left by the deceased. The rather swift funeral arrangements and subsequent cremation were carried out by the lawyer, who was assisted by the now late New Zealander’s former business partner.</p>

  <p class="indent">I ran some quick background checks on the Dane, who, it appeared, had a number of debts around town. However, it was noted that most of these debts had just recently been cleared. Certainly his night-time activities showed no signs of remorsefulness, or even of abating, but did indicate that he maintained a fairly expensive lifestyle.</p>

  <p class="indent">Requests for information or statements regarding the business venture remain unanswered, and a mention that perhaps the young girl is the retired officer’s only and rightful heir resulted in my being informed that he was not, in fact, her biological father. It was also mentioned that there was little money in the estate anyway. Just how this Danish businessman was privy to all this information … well, you connect the dots yourself, but a close link between lawyer, business partner and the companion/nurse seems all too evident. It certainly looks like a conspiracy, smells like a conspiracy, so more than likely it is a conspiracy. But how can I prove it?</p>

  <p class="indent">I called on what little authority I can muster in what I consider the quasi-cesspool that is Pattaya. Shortly after my contacts in authority made one or two enquiries into the death and subsequent events, lo and behold, a sudden payment from the lawyer was forwarded to the Thai family. No doubt, this was an attempt to placate what is a rather poor, and possibly very gullible, family. While obviously they were happy with the windfall, it has only served to further fuel my own suspicions.</p>

  <p class="indent">The girl’s grandmother, who is also her legal guardian, and her two aunties each received a payment of 100,000 Thai baht, far more than any of them would ever earn in a year, but seen in the light of the man’s estate, not that much. What, however, was even more suspect is that those payments were made to the women’s Thai nicknames. While the correct family names were on the payment cheques, instead of using their full and correct names (which the deceased man would have undoubtedly known), whoever wrote out the cheques used the women’s nicknames.</p>

  <p class="indent">This is something along the lines of leaving money to Posh, Sporty and Ginger Spice. Would an army man, a former lawyer himself, a stickler for correct procedure and doing things by the book, make out a will leaving things to Miss Chubby and Miss Crab when he undoubtedly knew their correct names as listed on their passports, or official Thai documents?</p>

  <p class="indent">Also proving something of a mystery is the so-called nurse. She was around for the initial few days following the death, and briefly met the deceased man’s little daughter and her family from visits in happier times. She was also aware that they came down to Pattaya immediately on being given news of the man’s passing. Shortly after that, however, the nurse disappeared.</p>

  <p class="indent">I can find no trace of her leaving the country, although it is a still today a simple matter to cross the border into Laos, Cambodia or Malaysia covertly. Also, Thailand is a very easy country in which to live quietly in an upcountry village and have limited contact with the outside world. Enquiries confirm that she is not wanted by police for any questioning, and the death and subsequent events are not being treated as suspicious. It is, to all intents and purposes, a closed case. Well, a closed case to all except one meddling private eye!</p>

  <p class="indent">The only solid information I have received is from the New Zealand side of this tangled web. There, any death must go to probate, and any estate over $10,000 must be passed through a high court. That information then becomes public, so I will shortly be able to trace what happened from this end. However, as to his house and investments in Thailand, things are looking increasingly murky.</p>

  <p class="indent">The company that had been set up in Pattaya to construct and ultimately run the zoo had, as required under Thai Law, the minimum slate of seven directors, each with equal powers. Again, as is required by Thai law, four of the seven had to be Thai nationals. Was the deceased fully aware of this? I rather doubt it.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Thai lawyer, his wife, the Dane’s Thai wife, and an office worker who was also a relation are shown on the company documentation as the Thai participants. They were joined by our late army man, the Dane and a British man I am still trying to locate. I would guess the Briton and the now deceased New Zealander were the major financial contributors, and they probably believed they had at least a half share in the company and had no idea they could be out-voted at any time. It has further become obvious that almost all of the deceased man’s rather ample funds I can track have found their way into the would-be zoological company’s account.</p>

  <p class="indent">A closer look at the company records, held at the registrar in Rachada, shows it was, in fact, formed at the same time as my fellow Kiwi was buying his Pattaya mansion. Further investigation has shown that the proposed site is today somewhat overgrown scrubland, with no signs of development, and is, indeed, up for sale. Looking into the history of the land also proved interesting. It just happened to be previously owned by that Pattaya lawyer, who had, in turn, sold it to the zoo company the day after said company was formed.</p>

  <p class="indent">Thus, the intrigues of investigations in Thailand and Southeast Asia continue, certainly often with more twists and turns than the more mundane cases my compatriots in the West usually face. As to the outcome of the above, well I shall attempt to keep you informed. I will add a note to the Thai Private Eye website should anything positive eventuate. For now, however, it poses a number of unsettling questions and reeks of fraud, corruption, and perhaps even murder. Unfortunately, many such cases in this region do just get filed away and closed, unanswered questions and all.</p>

  <p class="indent">I now think back to my very beginnings as a private eye, to my days in that upcountry hotel where it all started, and the fact that no one was ever charged or sought in connection with Uncle’s death. No I wonder if what is perhaps my last case is destined to end in a similar manner. Should that happen, I guess I will just have to take solace in the fact that amongst the numerous Thai traits and beliefs I have adopted over the years, <i class="calibre5">wen gum</i> – the Buddhist belief that doing bad deeds will come back to haunt you later in life – may still prove true in this particular instance.</p>
