  <p class="center1">True stories from the case files of Warren Olson<br class="calibre4"/>
  <br class="calibre4"/></p>

  <p class="center1">Warren Olson &amp; Stephen Leather</p>

  <p class="noindent">‘Two-timing bargirls, suspicious spouses and lesbian lovers – it was all in a day’s work for Bangkok Private Eye Warren Olson.’</p>

  <p class="indent">For more than a decade Olson walked the mean streets of the Big Mango. Fluent in Thai and Khamen, he was able to go where other Private Eyes feared to tread.</p>

  <p class="indent">His clients included Westerners who had lost their hearts – and life savings – to money-hungry bargirls. Nobody knows more than Warren Olson abou tthe tricks that bargirls can use to separate Western men from their hard-earned money. But he had more than his fair share of Thai clients, too, including a sweet old lady who was ripped off by a Christian conman and a Thai girl blackmailed by a former lover.</p>

  <p class="indent">The stories are based on Olson’s case files, fictionalised (to protect the innocent, and the guilty) by bestselling author Stephen Leather.</p>
