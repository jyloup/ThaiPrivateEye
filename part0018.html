  <h2 class="chtitle" id="heading_id_2">THE BEST PLANNED LAYS OF MEN AND MICE</h2>

  <p class="center">“The sure way to be cheated is to think one’s self more cunning than others”</p>

  <p class="center1">François de la Rochefoucauld</p>

  <p class="noindent">Thai Private Eye recently received an enquiry from a Hawaiian law firm that they had worked with previously. The law firm itself had been engaged by a woman who was obviously thinking along the lines of divorce proceedings, dependant on the outcome of a covert surveillance operation she had asked them to arrange during her husband’s alleged upcoming “business trip” to Bangkok. (Considering the number of business trips to Thailand we at TPE hear of, Bangkok may well be the business capital of the world, although the Thai stock exchange does not seem to reflect that.)</p>

  <p class="indent">Initially, the Hawaiian firm just supplied basic information, including the time frame and the hotel in question, and told us they would confirm the assignment with complete details, names, descriptions, et cetera in due course. The hotel mentioned was well known to us, so there was no need for a risk assessment. It was just a matter of configuring their room charges into our job estimate and confirming that we would have agents available for the period required to carry out the operation.</p>

  <p class="indent">The firm was happy with our estimates, and forwarded further details as well as the aim of the investigation so we could formulate a full itinerary and get preparations underway. They had not yet given us the subject’s name, but we did have a basic description. At that stage, the case controller put one and one together, and came up with a probable answer of two. The hotel in question, the time frame, and the physical description given all indicated it was possible that we already knew the subject.</p>

  <p class="indent">We were in the process of completing a minor local case for a client, and, of course, didn’t know his personal details; well, certainly we didn’t know his current marital status. We had been hired by him to investigate his current (and no doubt, very soon to be his former) Thai girlfriend.</p>

  <p class="indent">Our understanding was he not only doubted her integrity, but also felt the relationship had run its course. So perhaps in his own mind, he simply wanted a specific reason to end the affair, and as he stated, “move on”. He had informed us he would shortly be back in Bangkok and was looking forward to getting our final report. Guess what?</p>

  <p class="indent">This client was staying at the same hotel the Hawaiian firm had mentioned in their client’s request, and at the same time. Further, he bore an uncanny resemblance to the description we had been given. Whether the gods work in mysterious ways, or you just put it down to coincidence, but for a city of over 10 million people, it’s amazing how often the phrase “it’s a small world” seems to crop up in and around Bangkok!</p>

  <p class="indent">We awaited final confirmation and photographs from Hawaii before jumping to any conclusions. However, a few days later, they emailed us again, to say their client had cancelled the job. This nicely relieved us of any grappling with our conscience over matters of professional integrity or moral obligation on our part. But it was only later that it became crystal clear as to why that assignment had been cancelled.</p>

  <p class="indent">Meanwhile, our own client had now arrived in town and booked into the hotel in question. Control still had a nagging doubt, however, so thought it wise to just plant a seed of doubt in his mind and asked about his residential location and marital status.</p>

  <p class="indent">When told he was indeed married, and living in Hawaii, we casually suggested that perhaps one reason his wife didn’t object to his frequent trips to the Land of Smiles was just possibly because she was trying to catch him out with another woman. After all, he was a fairly wealthy man, and it could prove very costly to him if such was the case.</p>

  <p class="indent">At a meeting to hand over our final reports and DVDs which confirmed that his current girlfriend, like so many of her ilk, was seriously into drugs and gambling, it was suggested he make use of one of our close-protection personnel during his stay. Apart from possibly being himself checked on by his wife, we were sure that when his current girlfriend got her marching orders from the up-market apartment he had rented for her and the obligatory friends or hangers-on that Thai women with wealthy boyfriends tend to acquire, she would not be very happy and things might well turn nasty.</p>

  <p class="indent">As he was wealthy and had a lot to lose, especially on the possible divorce issue, it seemed a prudent move. However, he was so self-confident, indeed arrogant, that he merely passed it off as our being paranoid and attempting to get further work off him. He said that his wife was simply not clever enough to employ anyone to check up on him, as he had done with his girlfriend. He also added he would simply give the current Thai girl some money to “go away”.</p>

  <p class="indent">There was little we could do then, except shake our heads and wonder how someone so adept in the commercial world could be so ignorant of the female world, especially regarding Thai women involved in the night trade. (Which is where, of course, he had found the girlfriend.) He told our representative that he had everything under control, and not to waste his breath using what he termed “scare tactics” on him.</p>

  <p class="indent">He was, however, still our client, so our man again reminded him to be alert for any possible investigation organized by his wife, and to at least perhaps change hotels. It was further suggested he should certainly keep his whereabouts concealed from the apparently soon-to-be former Thai girlfriend when he ended that relationship. Advice, I should add, that he just waved away in the same cocky manner he believed he would be able to dismiss the girlfriend with.</p>

  <p class="indent">We do pride ourselves in putting our client’s needs and well-being first, and most are generally thankful for any additional help or advice we offer. In this case, as we learnt a little later on, another very common Thai phrase was certainly applicable: <i class="calibre5">“Som nom nar”.</i> (This is a Thai phrase, very often heard and meaning something like “serves you right” or “you got what you deserved.”)</p>

  <p class="indent">Our Bangkok patch being the surprisingly small world it is, we soon got word back that the Thai girlfriend had indeed been most unhappy about being shown the red card! As we had predicted, the now ex-girlfriend had turned to stalking our client, even physically attacking him one night, which resulted in his requiring a trip to hospital to get stitched up. She repeatedly came to his hotel, where he had remained despite our warning, and generally abused him at every opportunity – an ongoing tirade that apparently continues against the man to this very day, whenever she finds he’s back in Bangkok.</p>

  <p class="indent">Thai women certainly do tend to have “stickability”. No matter what you say or do, it is rare for any Thai you have befriended in the past to just walk away when asked – especially one you have made substantial monetary contributions to. Your phone number and email address will never get deleted, and it seems you are always kept in mind. Whether it’s that they believe there is some vague chance of a further windfall at some stage, or because they wish to remember your details so that they can continue to ask the gods to inflict grief or bad luck upon you, I’m not quite sure!</p>

  <p class="indent">Our arrogant client obviously did not have the most memorable sojourn in the Land of Smiles on that particular occasion. However, his worst troubles were yet to begin.</p>

  <p class="indent">On his return to Hawaii, neither his wife nor their grown-up son and daughter were at the airport to meet him, which was rather unusual. He called his palatial home a number of times, but, again strangely, there was no answer. He had to resort to hailing a taxi to complete his journey home. There he was met by his siblings and some other relatives, standing outside the family mansion and not apparently all that pleased to see him.</p>

  <p class="indent">Apparently, that’s when things really started plunging downhill for this fellow! He was prevented from entering his own home, as the locks had all been changed. His wife was nowhere to be seen, his own family had taken sides against him. He was now in total confusion – until he was actually handed a photo album featuring shots of him with various Thai girls … taking them to his hotel room at night, coming out with them in the morning, sometimes with more than one. All were nicely chronicled with dates, times, even incidents of bargirls he knew, or in confrontations with his ex-Thai girlfriend. Hotel receipts for multiple breakfasts, mini-bar and laundry receipts were all included – even some of the Thai girls’ full names and dates of birth that would have been obtained from their ID cards, held for security purposes by the hotel at reception during their brief stays. A full report of the attack on him by the aggrieved ex-girlfriend and his subsequent hospital treatment was also included. Not our work, but we had to admit, it was a job well done . and a job which could not have come cheaply!</p>

  <p class="indent">His clothes and personal belongings were all in a trailer hooked up to his 4WD, parked in the drive and ready to go. Like the investigators, the locksmith, and everything else his antagonists had hired, it had been paid for with his money. His expensive sports car was, however, locked away in the multi-garage of his home. That was the last straw, so, rather deflated, he could do little but retreat to a local hotel for a few days to reassess his situation.</p>

  <p class="indent">All this information came to us in dribs and drabs over the following few months, both from the would-be Hawaii 5-O star himself and from various locals and bargirls who, one way or another, had come into contact with him.</p>

  <p class="indent">It transpired that although his wife was indeed quiet, unassuming, and no doubt prepared to overlook his indiscretions in view of the luxurious lifestyle she enjoyed, his son and daughter were not so forgiving, and it was they who had initiated the investigation.</p>

  <p class="indent">Computer savvy, they had some time back installed a key logger on their father’s PC, and so had cracked his passwords. From there, reading through his emails, his sordid Thai history became very clear. Although claiming they were mostly upset by the humiliation their mother was facing, it was more likely the fact they could foresee their vast future inheritance being shared by a string of Thai bargirls that served as the catalyst for their strong reaction. Just to rub some premium salt into the wound, they had actually financed what had become a very expensive investigation with a spare credit card he had left with his wife “for emergencies”.</p>

  <p class="indent">The cost of the investigation was so high due to the fact that they had opted to bring in a Singaporean PI firm. This was necessary after the lawyers had originally advised the man’s family that Thai Private Eye could handle the investigation. From having read his emails, the son and daughter were well aware that their father had, in fact, employed us himself, so they evidently made a frantic call to the lawyers and told them not to divulge any further facts to us. They then found a company not based in Thailand to carry out the investigation. As the bill was being footed by his credit card, the expense was irrelevant. Consequently, the Singapore firm put three teams on the assignment, conducting 24-hour surveillance; thus, the very thorough and professional job.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was not too long before the man himself was back in Bangkok and, all too predictably, soon found yet another Thai girl he was besotted with and planned to marry. We thought perhaps he had learnt a little, as he called us to arrange a basic background check on any past husbands or children, or related obstacles. We had just begun the investigation when he called again, advising us to cancel any further work, as he now knew not only would she not lie to him, she was, in fact, “the one”. The requested dowry had been paid, and the village wedding planned for the following week.</p>

  <p class="indent">(Thai weddings are commonly held in upcountry villages, usually in the presence of monks, and involve a number of traditional rites. All parties are then happy that the marriage is official, although this is not, in fact, the case until that marriage is registered at the local municipal office or police station. This, however, is not always done, making the confirmation of whether a Thai person has actually been married previously not always as straightforward as our clients might expect.)</p>

  <p class="indent">Just what the current state of play is in this relationship, is anyone’s guess. However, this Hawaiian was one client who very much fit the bill of the male tourist who arrives in Asia with a lot of money and is looking for a girl with some experience. By the time most of these men leave, the girls will have the money, and they will have the experience!</p>

  <p class="indent">Shortly thereafterwards, we did, however, meet with a client who wisely took Thai Private Eye’s suggestions very seriously. This astute gentleman hailed from the Land of the Rising Sun.</p>

  <p class="indent">Japan certainly does more than its fair share to boost the Thai economy. Over the years they have provided more aid and assistance than all other countries combined. While Thai law restricts foreign ownership in most instances, there are, of course, always loopholes, and many Thai companies owe their financial position and success to Japanese backing and management.</p>

  <p class="indent">Consequently, there are many well-paid Japanese executives based in Bangkok, of which Mr Tobe was one. Their affluence is also not lost on some Thai women keen to increase the family fortunes. Those who bother to learn some of the Japanese language, and in particular the karaoke songs, can make four or five times more working in Soi Taniya than their sisters working in the adjacent Patpong bars. While many Thai girls are happy to have a Western sponsor who may give them a gold bracelet and forward around US$500 per month, those who can get themselves a Japanese executive as a sponsor may well receive US$2000 plus per month, more than most entire Thai families earn per year. In addition, they often receive a car to go with the gold bracelet, along with the obligatory up-market apartment.</p>

  <p class="indent">(Soi Taniya, by the way, is a small lane adjacent to the more well-known red light area of Bangkok known as Patpong. The majority of bars in this lane have a “karaoke” flavour and are restricted to Japanese patrons only. Cost of services, drinks and ladies is considerably higher – whether performance justifies that, we cannot say, but certainly some of the more attractive and better educated Thai girls involved in the entertainment industry are to be found at this location.)</p>

  <p class="indent">Tobe had gone past the sponsorship stage and had married his Thai girlfriend. The demanded dowry, or <i class="calibre5">sin sot</i> as it’s known, had been large and been paid, and the couple now lived in a very plush apartment. His wife had ample spending money and time to visit friends or go shopping while Tobe was at work, or on the weekends when he indulged in his other favoured pastime: playing golf.</p>

  <p class="indent">Lately, however, a few little inconsistencies and unexplained happenings were bugging him just enough to have him come and have a chat with our team. These little annoyances included things such as secretive text messages or the home phone occasionally going unanswered when the wife should have been at home. Nothing much, but put together, something he felt needed to be looked into. (Strangely enough, in all my years as a PI, there was rarely an occasion when a client who had doubts or misgivings about someone was found to be wrong!) Various options were discussed, and our hi-tech expert’s idea to go with a GPS tracking device installed in the wife’s vehicle was the one that most appealed to Tobe, so plans were made to run an operation based around one of those very handy devices.</p>

  <p class="indent">As there was an upcoming regional conference in Singapore that Tobe would be attending, so the surveillance was planned to coincide with that. He left his company vehicle at work on the Friday and told his wife he would be taking a taxi to the airport on Monday morning. Meanwhile, he would use her car on Saturday morning to meet up with his usual foursome out at the very pleasant Windsor Park golf course. That, then, was the first step in getting us the vehicle and giving our experts the time required to covertly install the GPS device.</p>

  <p class="indent">Attention to detail is, of course, paramount in our trade, so to begin with, photos were taken of the car’s interior to make sure all her personal items went back in the correct place. The floor mats were carefully lifted out, making sure all relevant dirt and rubbish remained in place and got put back on completion of the installation. Having the car go for a “grooming” is often much easier, but as Tobe had told us, he had never washed his wife’s car, so sending it for a valet cleaning in this instance would probably have aroused her counter-suspicions.</p>

  <p class="indent">Monday morning and all was in readiness. Tobe called us when he was in the taxi heading to the airport. His wife had said she would probably go upcountry to visit her parents for a few days, so she might not be able to contact him, as there was no mobile coverage in that particular remote area. Tobe had assured her that was fine and told her he would be back home Thursday evening.</p>

  <p class="indent">The wife’s movements were then easily monitored or tracked in real time on our computers, and once she was out and about, it was evident she was not heading towards her parents’ home in Chantaburi. The car was instead tracked to a medium-class block of apartments in the Ratchada district, so she may well have just gone to visit friends.</p>

  <p class="indent">Little action was noted until later in the evening, when the vehicle moved a few kilometres down the road to Rhamkamheng Soi 39 and into the car park at the up-market restaurant and nightclub called The Glass Home. Soon a couple of our agents were on the scene and wandered into the establishment known as a hang-out for trendy young Thais, many of whom were supposedly studying at the nearby university. It took them a little while to locate Tobe’s wife, but eventually they found her at a small table, apparently gazing deeply into the eyes of her dinner date, a <i class="calibre5">farang.</i></p>

  <p class="indent">The guy in question was, however, markedly different to her husband. Whereas Tobe was in his fifties, bespectacled, balding and would have looked rather out of place in such surroundings, the man with our client’s wife certainly did not. This fellow was about her age, late twenties, fit and good-looking. The agents had trouble gauging his nationality, as he spoke fluent Thai.</p>

  <p class="indent">Our agents in this case could hardly have been described as being in the young-and-hip swinging set either, so after getting a couple of discreet photos, they retreated to the car park and waited to see what developed. Whether the man was just a casual acquaintance or something rather more than that would, they hoped, soon be revealed.</p>

  <p class="indent">A few hours later, some vehicle movement was noted, and not surprisingly, the car went back to the Ratchada apartments. A number of agents were nearby, and just in case the two who had tracked Tobe’s wife in the nightclub were recognized, it was another pair of our Thai agents who just happened to wander through the apartment doors the same time as did the happy couple. Said happy couple had obviously had a pleasant, alcohol-soaked evening on Tobe’s hard-earned yen. Apart from some shopping trips, the vehicle remained at the apartments for most of the week while Tobe was in Singapore.</p>

  <p class="indent">One of our female Thai agents, feigning interest in the <i class="calibre5">farang,</i> approached the rather plain-looking apartment receptionist to seek more information about the hunk. This receptionist obviously fancied the playboy herself (although to no avail evidently) and was able to confirm that Mr Martin was, in fact, an Australian teacher, and that his rich girlfriend often visited him.</p>

  <p class="indent">Tobe returned home towards the end of the week and used the same golfing excuse to return the vehicle to us, to pick up our reports, and to also let us retrieve the GPS. That latter is a handy piece of equipment which in a city like Bangkok can be an invaluable tool in vehicle tracking. Similar apparatuses we have tried, such as magnetic slap and track sticks, we found both expensive and unreliable in comparison to the GPS.</p>

  <p class="indent">Tobe was, of course, disappointed in his wife’s actions. As he pointed out, after six or seven years of marriage, he could have understood it, but after only six or seven months, it was a bit hard to take. Nonetheless, he was very pragmatic and had also taken the precaution of having her sign a pre-nuptial agreement; he wasn’t a company CEO for nothing!</p>

  <p class="indent">We had learnt her affair with Martin had been going on for some time. In fact, she had met him when she went for some English lessons prior to learning Japanese. She was somewhat pragmatic herself, in that she put marriage to a wealthy Japanese man ahead of having fun with someone closer to her own age. However, once financially secure (or so she thought), she had again linked up with the guy she herself was infatuated with. We did manage to get into a conversation with a friend of Martin’s at his local bar and learnt that the Lothario teacher was himself enamoured with a new young student, parallel to his being regularly wined and dined by the wife of a wealthy Japanese.</p>

  <p class="indent">What did I say about <i class="calibre5">wen gum,</i> the Thai equivalent of “Do unto others”? Tobe went ahead and completed divorce proceedings immediately, slightly consoled to learn his ex would not become the respected partner of an esteemed teacher, as she imagined. He was also grateful to us, and the use of a GPS, for bringing his wife’s indiscretions to light so quickly.</p>
